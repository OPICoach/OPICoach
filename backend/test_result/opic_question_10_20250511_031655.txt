답변: A special event I went to recently was my friends birthday party. It was at a fun place with a lot of games and food. I went with some of my other friends, and we played games like tag and raced each other. There was also a huge cake, and we all sang "Happy Birthday" to my friend. What made it really memorable was that my friend got a surprise gift from all of us, and her face lit up when she saw it. It was a fun day because we all laughed a lot and spent time together.


피드백:
Good Point
답변 내용이 질문의 요구사항을 명확하게 잘 따르고 있어요. A special event I went to recently was my friends birthday party.처럼 어떤 행사였는지, I went with some of my other friends처럼 누구와 함께 갔는지, 그리고 What made it really memorable was that my friend got a surprise gift from all of us, and her face lit up when she saw it.처럼 무엇이 기억에 남았는지 핵심 정보를 잘 전달했어요. 특히 친구가 선물을 받고 her face lit up이라는 표현은 감정을 생생하게 전달해줘서 아주 좋았어요!

Bad Point
전반적으로 사용된 어휘나 문장 구조가 다소 단순한 편이에요. 예를 들어 It was at a fun place with a lot of games and food.에서 fun place나 a lot of games and food 같은 표현은 조금 더 구체적이거나 다양한 어휘로 바꿔보면 답변이 풍부해질 수 있어요. a lively arcade with various games and delicious snacks처럼요. 또한 문장들이 대부분 짧고 단조롭게 이어지는 경향이 있어서, 접속사나 관계대명사를 활용해 문장 간의 연결을 좀 더 매끄럽게 하면 좋을 것 같아요.

Overall Feedback
이야기의 흐름이 자연스럽고 전달하고자 하는 내용은 명확해서 듣기 편안한 답변이었어요. 하지만 OPIC에서 더 높은 등급을 목표한다면, 어휘의 폭을 넓히고 다양한 문장 구조를 사용하는 연습이 필요해요. 예를 들어, 감정이나 상황을 묘사할 때 좀 더 생생하고 구체적인 형용사나 부사를 사용해 보세요. 현재 답변은 내용을 이해하는 데는 무리가 없지만, 표현의 다양성 측면에서 IM1IM2 수준으로 평가될 수 있어요. 조금 더 살을 붙이고 세련된 표현을 추가한다면 IH 수준까지도 충분히 노려볼 수 있을 거예요!

Teachers Answer
Alright, a really memorable recent event was my cousins engagement party. It took place at a lovely little Italian restaurant downtown, one thats known for its cozy atmosphere. I went with my immediate family  my parents and my sister. We had a fantastic multicourse meal, and there was a lot of toasting and sharing funny stories about the couple. What made it particularly memorable for me was the surprise slideshow her fiancé had prepared. It was filled with photos of them from when they first met up to their engagement, set to their favorite songs. My cousin was so touched, she actually teared up a bit! Seeing her genuine happiness and the love between them, surrounded by close family and friends, made it a truly heartwarming and unforgettable evening.
