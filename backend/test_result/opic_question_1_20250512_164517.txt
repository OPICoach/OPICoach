질문: Question
Think about a recent activity you did that you found particularly enjoyable or relaxing. It could be anything from pursuing a hobby, attending a social event, or even just a quiet moment you experienced. What was this activity? When and where did it take place, and who were you with, if anyone? Please describe what you did and explain in detail why you found this activity so enjoyable or relaxing.
답변: One recent activity I found very relaxing was taking a walk in the park near my house. It was last Sunday afternoon, and the weather was perfect  sunny but not too hot. I went there alone to clear my mind and just enjoy some quiet time. I listened to music while walking slowly, and I also sat on a bench for a while to watch the trees and people passing by. It felt peaceful because I had no stress or pressure at that moment. I really enjoyed it because it helped me refresh my mind and feel calm again.

Good Point
학생 답변은 질문의 모든 요소를 명확하고 간결하게 잘 다루고 있어요. last Sunday afternoon처럼 구체적인 시간 언급이나 clear my mind, refresh my mind, peaceful 같은 감정상태 묘사 어휘 선택이 아주 좋습니다. It felt peaceful because I had no stress or pressure at that moment. 문장처럼 자신의 감정과 그 이유를 설명하는 부분도 논리적이고요. 전반적으로 답변의 구조가 안정적이고 이해하기 쉽습니다.

Bad Point
문법적으로는 훌륭하지만, 답변이 다소 단조롭게 느껴질 수 있는 부분이 있어요. 예를 들어 the weather was perfect sunny but not too hot에서 perfect와 sunny를 연결할 때 perfectly sunny 또는 perfect it was sunny... 와 같이 표현하면 더 자연스러웠을 거예요. 또한, I listened to music while walking slowly, and I also sat on a bench...처럼 두 가지 행동을 나열할 때, 조금 더 생동감 있는 표현이나 부가 설명을 더하면 좋을 것 같아요. 예를 들어, 음악을 들으며 천천히 걷다가, 마음에 드는 벤치에 잠시 앉아 지나가는 사람들과 살랑이는 나뭇잎들을 바라보았어요 와 같이 약간의 묘사를 더하는 거죠.

Overall Feedback
전반적으로 답변 내용이 명확하고, 질문의 요구사항을 잘 충족했어요. 감정 표현 어휘도 좋고요. 다만, 조금 더 자연스러운 연결어나 다양한 문장 구조, 그리고 약간의 생생한 묘사를 추가하면 답변이 훨씬 풍성해질 거예요. 예를 들어, 단순히 listened to music 대신 I put on my favorite playlist and... 와 같이 구체적인 상황을 묘사하면 듣는 사람이 더 몰입할 수 있답니다. 현재 답변은 IM3에서 IH 사이 수준으로 평가할 수 있어요. 세부 묘사가 좋고 문법적 오류가 적지만, AL 수준으로 가기 위해서는 좀 더 복잡한 문장 구성과 표현의 다양성, 그리고 자연스러운 발화 느낌이 필요합니다.

Teachers Answer
Absolutely! Just last weekend, I had a wonderfully relaxing experience. It was Saturday morning, and I decided to visit a local botanical garden Id heard about. I went by myself because I really wanted some peaceful me time. The weather was just gorgeous  sunny with a gentle breeze. I spent a couple of hours just meandering through the different sections, admiring the vibrant flowers and the towering trees. I found a quiet bench by a small pond and just sat there, observing the ducks and listening to the subtle sounds of nature. It was incredibly calming because there were no demands on my time, no emails to check, just the beauty of my surroundings. This experience was so enjoyable because it allowed me to completely disconnect from my usual routine and recharge my batteries, leaving me feeling refreshed and serene.
