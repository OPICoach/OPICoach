질문: Learning a new skill can be a challenging yet rewarding experience. Think about a time you learned a new skill, whether it was for a hobby, for school, or for work. What skill did you learn, what was the learning process like, and how did you feel once you acquired it? Please describe this experience in detail.


답변: I learned how to play the guitar a few months ago. At first, it was very difficult because my fingers hurt and I didnt know how to move them properly. I watched YouTube videos and tried to follow along every day. Sometimes I got frustrated because I made a lot of mistakes. But I didnt give up and kept practicing. After a few weeks, I was able to play a simple song. I felt really proud and happy when I finally played it well. It was hard, but it was also fun and a good experience.

Good Point
학생의 답변은 질문의 요구사항을 모두 충족시키면서 경험을 시간 순서대로 잘 설명했어요. 특히 At first, it was very difficult because my fingers hurt처럼 초기 어려움을 구체적으로 언급하고, I watched YouTube videos and tried to follow along every day 같이 학습 과정을 명확히 제시한 점이 좋았습니다. I felt really proud and happy처럼 감정 표현도 잘 담아냈고요. 전반적으로 이해하기 쉽고 명료한 답변입니다!

Bad Point
문장 구조가 다소 단조롭고 어휘의 폭이 제한적인 점이 아쉬워요. 예를 들어, very difficult, a lot of mistakes, good experience 같은 표현들은 더 구체적이거나 다양한 어휘로 대체될 수 있어요. I didnt know는 I didnt know로, 줄임말을 사용할 때 아포스트로피를 넣어주면 더 좋고요 물론 구어체에서는 크게 문제되지 않지만, 인지하고 있으면 좋습니다. After a few weeks, I was able to play a simple song에서 어떤 노래였는지, 혹은 simple을 좀 더 자세히 묘사했다면 내용이 풍부해졌을 거예요.

Overall Feedback
전반적으로 질문의 핵심을 잘 파악하고 답변했지만, IMIntermediate Mid 수준에서 더 높은 점수를 받기 위해서는 어휘와 문장 구조의 다양성을 확보하고, 내용을 조금 더 구체적으로 확장하는 연습이 필요해 보여요. 예를 들어, 기타 연습이 왜 fun했는지, 어떤 점에서 good experience였는지 한두 문장 덧붙이면 훨씬 생생한 답변이 될 거예요. 지금의 답변은 내용 전달은 명확하지만, 세부 묘사와 표현의 다채로움이 부족하여 IM1 난이도 34 사이 정도로 평가할 수 있습니다. 조금만 더 살을 붙이면 금방 IM2 이상으로 올라갈 수 있을 거예요!

Teachers Answer
A skill I dedicated time to learning was photography, probably about two years ago. Id always admired beautiful photos but felt my own snapshots were quite bland. The learning process was initially quite daunting. There were so many technical terms like aperture, shutter speed, and ISO, and understanding how they interacted felt like learning a new language. I started by watching countless online tutorials and devouring articles. Then, Id go out and practice, mostly through trial and error, which led to a lot of frustratingly blurry or poorly lit shots. However, I kept at it, and a friend whos a good photographer gave me some invaluable tips. The real breakthrough came when I finally grasped the exposure triangle. Suddenly, it all clicked! When I took my first truly wellexposed, creatively composed photo, I felt an immense sense of accomplishment and elation. It was more than just learning a skill it felt like a whole new way of seeing and appreciating the world around me had opened up. It was challenging, for sure, but incredibly rewarding.
