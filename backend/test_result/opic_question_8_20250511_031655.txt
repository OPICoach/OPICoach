질문: Id like you to tell me about a recent special occasion or celebration that you experienced. It could be a birthday, a holiday, an anniversary, or any other kind of gathering. What was the event, and who did you celebrate with? Please describe what you did and what made it a memorable experience for you.


답변: A recent special occasion I experienced was my sisters birthday last month. We had a small party at home with just our family, but it was still really nice. We decorated the living room with balloons and lights, and my mom cooked all of my sisters favorite foods like fried chicken, noodles, and a big chocolate cake. I gave her a gift I bought online, and she looked really happy when she opened it. We also played some games and took a lot of photos together. It wasnt a big or fancy celebration, but it felt warm and fun. One thing I didnt do well was forgetting to prepare a birthday card, so I just said a few words on the spot, and it felt a little awkward. Still, I think she liked it. What made the day memorable was just spending time together and seeing my sister smile a lot.

Good Point
OO님, 답변 잘 봤어요! 여동생 생일파티 경험을 이야기해 주셨는데, We decorated the living room with balloons and lights, and my mom cooked all of my sisters favorite foods like fried chicken, noodles, and a big chocolate cake.처럼 구체적인 묘사가 아주 좋았어요. 덕분에 생생하게 장면이 그려졌답니다. 특히 One thing I didnt do well was forgetting to prepare a birthday card, so I just said a few words on the spot, and it felt a little awkward. 부분은 예상치 못한 상황과 그에 대한 솔직한 감정을 드러내서 답변을 더 흥미롭고 인간적으로 만들어 주었어요. on the spot이라는 표현도 아주 자연스럽게 잘 사용하셨고요!

Bad Point
전반적으로 좋은 답변이었지만, 몇 가지 아쉬운 점을 짚어보자면, really nice, really happy처럼 really라는 부사가 반복적으로 사용된 경향이 있어요. 물론 자연스러운 구어체 표현이지만, genuinely happy나 truly enjoyable 같이 좀 더 다양한 부사나 형용사를 활용하면 표현력이 풍부해져서 IH 상위권이나 AL 수준까지도 노려볼 수 있을 거예요. it felt a little awkward 부분도 I felt a bit flustered 또는 my impromptu speech felt a bit clumsy 등으로 감정을 더 구체적으로 표현하면 좋았을 것 같아요.

Overall Feedback
전체적으로 답변의 흐름이 자연스럽고, 과거 경험을 구체적인 예시와 함께 잘 설명해주셨어요. 특히 솔직한 자기반성forgetting to prepare a birthday card을 포함시킨 점이 인상적입니다. 이는 답변을 단순한 나열이 아닌 하나의 이야기로 만들어주죠. 어휘의 다양성을 조금 더 확보하고, 감정 표현을 풍부하게 한다면 훨씬 좋은 점수를 받을 수 있을 거예요. 현재 답변은 구체적인 내용과 적절한 시제 사용, 그리고 자연스러운 이야기 전개를 고려했을 때 IH Intermediate High 수준에 해당합니다. 이야기 구조와 세부 묘사가 좋지만, 어휘의 다양성과 표현의 정교함에서 AL로 가기에는 조금 아쉬운 부분이 있습니다.

Teachers Answer
Oh, a recent special occasion let me think. Right! Just last month, actually, my close friend, Alex, got a big promotion at work. So, a few of us decided to throw him a surprise celebration dinner. We booked a table at his favorite Italian restaurant, you know, the one with the amazing lasagna. I was in charge of getting a cake and some subtle decorations  nothing too overthetop. When Alex walked in and saw us all, his face was priceless! He was genuinely shocked and then incredibly happy. We spent the evening reminiscing, laughing, and of course, toasting to his success. What made it truly memorable was seeing how much it meant to him and just sharing that collective joy. It wasnt extravagant, but the genuine surprise and camaraderie made it really special.
