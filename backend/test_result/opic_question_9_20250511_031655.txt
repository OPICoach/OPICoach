--- 문제 9 ---
질문: I understand from your survey that you enjoy going to parks. Could you describe a park you frequently visit? What does it look like, and what activities do you usually do there? Also, tell me about a memorable experience youve had at that park.


답변: I often visit a park near my house. It's a peaceful place with a lot of trees and a small pond in the middle. There are walking paths, benches, and a playground. I usually go for a walk or jog there, and sometimes I just sit and relax by the pond. One memorable time was when I went there with a few friends for a picnic. The weather was perfect, and we spent hours chatting and playing frisbee. It was a simple but really enjoyable day.

Good Point
학생의 답변은 질문의 모든 부분을 충실히 다루고 있어요. 공원의 모습a peaceful place with a lot of trees and a small pond, 평소 활동go for a walk or jog there, and sometimes I just sit and relax, 그리고 기억에 남는 경험went there with a few friends for a picnic까지 명확하게 전달했네요. 특히 The weather was perfect처럼 자연스러운 표현을 사용한 점이 좋았어요.

Bad Point
답변이 명확하긴 하지만, 어휘나 문장 구조가 다소 단조로운 느낌이 있어요. 예를 들어 a lot of trees 대신 lush greenery나 numerous tall trees처럼 더 구체적이거나 생생한 어휘를 사용하면 좋았을 거예요. It was a simple but really enjoyable day라는 마무리도 좋지만, 왜 그렇게 즐거웠는지에 대한 감정이나 생각을 조금 더 자세히 덧붙였다면 표현력이 더 살아났을 거예요. 예를 들어, It was simple, yet the shared laughter and carefree moments made it an incredibly refreshing and enjoyable day 와 같이요.

Overall Feedback
전반적으로 질문의 요지를 잘 파악하고 답변을 구성했어요. 다만, OPIC에서 더 높은 등급을 목표한다면 어휘의 다양성을 늘리고, 문장 구조에 변화를 주면서 감정이나 세부 묘사를 풍부하게 하는 연습이 필요해요. 예를 들어, 단순 나열보다는 연결어나 부사구를 활용하여 문장을 확장하고, 감정을 나타내는 형용사나 부사를 적극적으로 사용해 보세요. 현재 답변은 핵심 내용을 잘 전달하고 있지만, 표현의 다채로움과 깊이 면에서 조금 더 발전시키면 좋을 것 같습니다. 이 답변은 IM2 Intermediate Mid 2 수준으로 평가할 수 있어요. 명확성은 있지만, 좀 더 풍부한 어휘와 복잡한 문장 구조를 사용하면 IH 수준으로 올라갈 수 있습니다.

Teachers Answer
Well, theres this charming park I frequently visit called Willow Creek Park, just a short bike ride from my home. Its quite picturesque, actually. It has sprawling green lawns, clusters of tall, shady willow trees, and a meandering creek that flows through the middle, which is probably its main attraction. There are wellpaved jogging paths, rustic wooden benches, and a surprisingly wellequipped childrens playground. I usually go there for a brisk walk or a light jog to clear my head. Sometimes, I just find a quiet spot by the creek, listen to the water, and read a book.

Speaking of memorable experiences, about a year ago, I was there after a heavy rainstorm. The creek, usually quite gentle, was swollen and rushing with surprising force. The air was incredibly fresh, and the whole park seemed washed clean and vibrant. As I was walking, I saw a family of ducks comically struggling to navigate the stronger currents. It wasnt anything dramatic, but that vivid scene of natures power and the resilience of those little ducks, combined with the crisp air, just stuck with me. It was a simple moment, but very grounding and memorable.
