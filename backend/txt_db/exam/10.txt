Feedback 
Overall Structure: The answer follows the basic structure of explaining the problem and asking questions to resolve it, which is good for Role-play Question 12 (No, Yes structure).

Specific Feedback:
- "Hello": It's recommended to start with "Hi" as "Hello" can sound less natural or slightly impolite in this context.
- "in pink color", "with blue color", "blue color": Avoid using "color" after the color name. Simply say "in pink" or "in blue".
- Explaining the problem: The explanation is brief and clear, which is effective.
- First Question ("Can you change for me?"): This is the first attempt to resolve the problem. It's good to ask a question. However, using more polite phrasing like "Could you send me a pink one?" or "Would it be possible to change it?" is recommended for a store employee.
- Reaction to 'No' ("Oh my god, I can't?"): The reaction is good, showing surprise. However, after the 'No' response to the first question, it's crucial to ask 'Why?' (e.g., "Why not?" or "May I ask why?") and show understanding of the reason given (e.g., "Oh, it's sold out?"). This step was missed.
- "That's too bad": While understandable, this phrase can sound awkward if the intonation isn't perfect. Alternatives like "How unfortunate" or even slang like "That sucks" (used appropriately) can sound more natural if delivered confidently.
- Second Question ("then can I just um, refund my iPhone 10?"): This is the second attempt to resolve the problem, leading to the 'Yes' response. This follows the Q12 structure correctly.
- Ending after 'Yes': After getting the 'Yes' response for the refund, simply confirming the refund request (e.g., "All right, then I'd like a refund, please.") and ending the call is sufficient. Adding details about arranging the schedule afterward makes the response unnecessarily long and complicated for the OPIc test. Keep it concise after the problem is resolved.
- Showing Interaction: When the simulated person gives the 'Yes' response (e.g., "You could?"), repeating or acknowledging it shows good interaction (e.g., "I could? Oh, great!"). This was done briefly but could be more explicit.
- Pronoun Agreement: Pay attention to pronoun agreement when repeating the response. If you ask "Could I get a refund?" the response is "You could." If you ask "Could you give me a refund?" the response is "I could." Ensure your follow-up matches (e.g., "Oh, I could?").
