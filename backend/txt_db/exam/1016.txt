Question 
Tell me about a time when you were not able to attend a concert or a performance.

Answer 
The video suggests two options: Option 1 is to create a short, simple story about a time you couldn't attend. Example phrases include: "I had an experience like that a few years ago.", "I remember a time when I couldn't attend a concert.", "So I had to call my friend and cancel our plan.", "I had to sell or we had to sell our tickets." Option 2 is to honestly state that you have no such experience. Example phrases include: "Well let me see.", "Sorry. I don't have any experience like that.", "I can't think of any experience like that.", "I've never experienced a problem related to [topic].", "I'll just skip this question."

Feedback 
The video emphasizes the importance of preparing for this type of unexpected past experience question, especially when paired with roleplay. For Option 1, practice the story to deliver it smoothly. For Option 2, practice the phrases to sound natural and confident while stating you lack the experience and potentially asking to skip the question.
