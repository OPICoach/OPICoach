Example phrases include: "Well let me see.", "Let's see.", "Let me think.", "Sorry but I don't have any experience like that.", "Yeah I mean seriously I've never really cancelled my trip."

Feedback 
The video advises practicing the chosen approach. If choosing Option 1, ensure the story is clear and easy to follow.

Delivering the message clearly is important, regardless of the option.
