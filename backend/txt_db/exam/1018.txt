Question 
Have you ever had a problem with an appliance or a device? And how did you solve it? How did you handle it?

Answer 
The video suggests preparing for this common question, especially for higher levels. Option 1 is to tell a story about a device problem and how it was handled. An example story involves a phone not working. Example phrases: "I had an experience like that a few years ago.", "One day my phone didn't work properly.", "All of a sudden it didn't turn on.", "Honestly it was a very old phone.", "I had been using the phone for like three years, five years." (for past perfect), "I had to buy a new phone.", "I bought I got a new phone." Option 2 is to state you've never had such a problem using phrases like: "I've never had an experience like that."

Feedback 
The video strongly recommends preparing a story for this specific question type, especially for IH to AL levels, rather than skipping it. A simple solution like buying a new item can be easier to describe than a complex repair. Practice the story and relevant vocabulary, including different tenses if aiming for higher scores.
