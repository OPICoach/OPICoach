Question 
Tell me about a time you had to cancel a meeting or plan at the last minute.

Answer 
As with other experience questions, the video suggests either preparing a story (Option 1) or stating you have no such experience (Option 2). If choosing Option 2, the video mentions preparing phrases like "I've never had an experience like that."

Feedback 
The video highlights that for any chosen approach (story or no experience), it's crucial to be able to deliver at least five clear sentences to convey your message effectively. Practice speaking out loud to improve confidence and delivery.
