Question 
You decide to take dance lessons together with your friends. To your great disappointment, it was actually quite boring and you want to leave. Tell your friend about it and give two to three alternatives.

Answer 
Yeah, well, I don't know about this class. It's not what I've expected before I came, so can we just go now? Oh, no. That's your mother? Seriously? Okay, then um let me think. Um how about uh we tell her that I'm not feeling well, so you have to take me out to the hospital or something. Would that work for you? Yeah? Okay, thank you. Let's go.

Feedback 
The answer effectively addresses the prompt by expressing dissatisfaction and proposing alternatives. Starting with "Yeah, well, I don't know about this class" is good, and using "I don't know" shows honesty. "It's not what I expected before I came" clearly explains the disappointment. The first question, "can we just go now?", is a direct and relevant attempt to solve the problem. The reaction "Oh, no." shows emotion well, especially the use of "oh". Repeating the friend's statement ("That's your mother?") and adding "Seriously?" is a good way to show engagement, though practice on the pronunciation of "serious" is recommended. Using fillers like "um" and the phrase "let me think" effectively shows the thinking process. The second suggestion, "How about we tell her that I'm not feeling well, so you have to take me out to the hospital or something", is a detailed alternative. Asking "Would that work for you?" is a strong way to confirm the suggestion. While "How about" is acceptable, practicing "What about" can sound more natural. The final response "Yeah? Okay, thank you. Let's go." is concise. It's recommended to explicitly show the friend's acceptance before the final statement, perhaps by saying "That works for you?" then "Yeah" (the '진짜' method), followed by the conclusion.
