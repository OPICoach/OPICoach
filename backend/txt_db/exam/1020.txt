Question 
Could you please describe the most common type of public transportation in your country? There are various means of public transportation these days. What do you use the most and why? Is there any difference between the transportation you used in your childhood and the one you use today? If so, could you please describe some of the differences?

Answer 
In my country, the most common type of public transportation is the subway. It's very convenient because it connects many places in the city quickly. I use the subway the most because I don't have a car and it's cheaper than taxis. When I was a child, I mostly used buses. Buses were slower and sometimes crowded, but they were everywhere. Today, subways are much faster and more reliable, and they cover a wider area. The biggest difference is speed and coverage.

Feedback 
Overall, your answer is clear, well-structured, and directly addresses all parts of the question. You use simple but effective language to explain your points.

**Sentence Structure:**
- Your sentences are generally short and easy to understand, which is good for clarity.
- You use comparative structures effectively (e.g., 'cheaper than taxis', 'slower and sometimes crowded', 'much faster and more reliable', 'wider area').
- To add a bit more complexity and potentially improve your score, you could try combining some ideas using conjunctions or dependent clauses. For example, instead of two separate sentences: 'When I was a child, I mostly used buses. Buses were slower and sometimes crowded...', you could say: 'When I was a child, I mostly used buses, which were slower and sometimes crowded.' Or, to compare past and present more directly: 'Whereas in my childhood I primarily relied on buses, today I mostly use the subway, which offers greater speed and coverage.'

**Vocabulary:**
- You use appropriate vocabulary to describe transportation features (convenient, quickly, cheaper, slower, crowded, reliable, wider area, speed, coverage).
- 'Everywhere' is a bit informal but understandable in context. You could use phrases like 'widely available' or 'had extensive routes' for a slightly more formal tone, but 'everywhere' works fine here.
- Words like 'convenient' and 'reliable' are good adjectives to use when describing public transport.

**Flow and Cohesion:**
- Your answer flows logically from identifying the most common type to discussing your personal use and then comparing past and present.
- The transition words like 'When I was a child' and 'Today' clearly signal the shift in topic.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Practice varying your sentence structure slightly to include a mix of simple and complex sentences.
- Consider adding a specific example of a place the subway connects or a time when it was particularly convenient.
- While your vocabulary is functional, learning synonyms for common words (e.g., 'efficient' instead of 'convenient and quickly') can help demonstrate a wider range.

Overall, this is a solid answer for the OPIc. Focusing on slight variations in sentence structure would be the next step for higher levels.
