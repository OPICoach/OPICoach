Question 
Do you remember the neighborhood you lived when you were young? How is your neighborhood like today? Compare and contrast some differences you see.

Answer 
Well. The neighborhood I'm living in right now is very different from my old neighborhood. To start with, I used to live in the countryside. So amenities were very limited and it took ages to get to a grocery store. Oh and, there was a big park nearby. It had breathtaking scenery and fresh air. It was amazing to take a walk to refresh my mind. Now these days, I live in a downtown. Everything is new to me. It's very different from my old neighborhood. because everything is located within walking distance from my house. For example, a convenience store is only a minute walk from my house. It's really convenient. But I have to say I miss my old neighborhood.

Feedback 
This question asks for a comparison between your past and present neighborhood. The key is to use past tense for the past and present tense for the present. To have more to say, it's good to make the past and present neighborhoods very different (e.g., countryside vs. downtown), even if it's not true. Useful expressions: 'I used to' (past habit), 'amenities were very limited' (limited facilities), 'it took ages' (took a very long time - fancy expression), 'breathtaking scenery' (amazing view), 'refresh my mind' (clear your head), 'within walking distance' (close enough to walk), 'is only a minute walk' (very close), 'convenient' (convenient) vs. 'comfortable' (comfortable). Giving examples ('For example') makes your answer more convincing. Starting with 'Well' can be a good filler.
