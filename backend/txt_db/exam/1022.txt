Question 
How has the relationship between your country and neighboring countries changed? What is the reason for that change?

Answer 
Um this is a very difficult question. I haven't thought about this. But I will try my best to answer. I'd like to talk about the relationship between 우리나라 and 중국과요. There have been a lot of changes in the relationship between the two countries. For example in the past, There was not much interaction between the two countries. Thus, There were not many Chinese tourists in Korea. Oh and as far as I know, Korean music was not that popular in China. But nowadays, Korean pop songs and singers are really really popular in China. all the rage. As a result, There is more interaction between the two countries. I mean, Many Chinese people are visiting Korea. And tourism industry is getting bigger day by day. I personally think that This is the biggest change between 한국 and 중국이라는 거죠.

This is a difficult social issue question. It's okay to acknowledge the difficulty ('This is a very difficult question. I haven't thought about this. But I will try my best to answer'). Choose an easy topic like K-pop and China rather than complex historical or political issues. You don't need to talk for too long. Useful expressions: 'There have been a lot of changes in' (speak this quickly), 'not much interaction' (not much exchange), 'as far as I know' (good filler), 'all the rage' (very popular, trendy - fancy expression), 'as a result' (consequently), 'I mean' (to clarify), 'day by day' (increasingly), 'I personally think that' (express your opinion). You can also add a personal example related to K-pop.
