Question 
Tell me about your home.

Answer 
You know, I gotta say what I really love about my home is my storage room. It's just so spacious. You see, my home isn't all that big, but you know, it's not all that small either. But none of that really matters, I guess, because I love how big my storage room is.

Feedback 
When describing something, start with a clear main point using expressions like 'What I really love about... is...'. Avoid 'my favorite... is' and use 'I like/love' instead. Incorporate natural fillers like 'all that', 'but you know', 'but I gotta say', 'just', 'you see', 'really', and 'I guess' to make your speech sound more natural and conversational. A recommended structure is to start with your main point, then provide descriptive fillers about other aspects, and then naturally return to your main point to elaborate further.
