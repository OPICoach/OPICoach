Question 
Please talk about something interesting or special that has happened while doing housework. When did it happen? What sort of housework were you doing?

Answer 
One time, I was cleaning my room, maybe last year. I was tidying up my desk drawers and I found a very old letter. It was from my best friend from elementary school, who had moved away. We lost touch over the years, so finding that letter was really special. It brought back so many memories.

Feedback 
Your answer is good and directly addresses the question. You used 'tidying up', which is a good phrase for cleaning. 'lost touch' is also appropriate vocabulary. To make it even better, you could add a little more detail about the letter itself or how it made you feel immediately upon finding it. For instance, 'I found a very old letter, yellowed with age.' or 'Finding that letter gave me a jolt of nostalgia.'
