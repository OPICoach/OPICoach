Question 
What do you do to stay healthy? For instance, some people take a group exercise class or take a cooking class. Describe what you do in details.

Answer 
To stay healthy, I try to maintain a balanced lifestyle. First, I focus on my diet. I eat lots of vegetables and fruits and try to limit processed foods and sugar. I also make sure to drink plenty of water. Second, I exercise regularly. I usually go to the gym three times a week, doing a mix of cardio and weight training. Sometimes I also enjoy hiking on weekends. Lastly, I prioritize sleep, aiming for seven to eight hours a night, because I believe good rest is crucial for health.

Feedback 
Your answer is well-structured, covering diet, exercise, and sleep. Using transition words like 'First', 'Second', and 'Lastly' makes it easy to follow. 'maintain a balanced lifestyle' is a good opening phrase. You provided specific examples like 'lots of vegetables and fruits' and 'three times a week, doing a mix of cardio and weight training'. 'prioritize sleep' and 'crucial for health' are good vocabulary choices. This is a strong answer.
