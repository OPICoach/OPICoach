Question 
Tell me about a memorable holiday experience you had as a child. What exactly happened on that holiday? What made it so memorable?

Answer 
My most memorable holiday experience as a child was one Christmas when I was about seven years old. My grandparents came to visit, and it snowed heavily, which was quite rare where we lived. We spent the whole day inside, gathered around the fireplace. My grandmother told us stories, and we played board games. In the evening, we decorated the Christmas tree together. It wasn't about the gifts, but the feeling of warmth, togetherness, and the magical atmosphere created by the snow and my family being all together. That feeling of cozy happiness is what made it so special and memorable.

Feedback 
This is a lovely and detailed story. You set the scene well with 'one Christmas when I was about seven years old' and 'it snowed heavily'. Describing the activities like 'gathered around the fireplace', 'told us stories', 'played board games', and 'decorated the Christmas tree' adds richness. The vocabulary 'magical atmosphere' and 'cozy happiness' effectively convey the feeling. You clearly explained *why* it was memorable, focusing on the feeling of togetherness rather than just the events. Excellent answer.
