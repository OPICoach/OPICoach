Question 
Tell me about coffee. Do you like it? Why? How do you feel if you don't drink it? When did you start drinking it and why?

Answer 
Yes, I like coffee because it gives me energy. If I don't drink it, I'm so tired. I drink one cup a day in my company. I started drinking coffee when I was 20 years old because every adult have a coffee, so I wondered about it. I tried it and it was delicious.

Feedback 
Your answer was understandable, but to improve from IM1 to IM2, focus on grammar like 'have' vs 'has'. 'Every adult have a coffee' should be 'Every adult has coffee'. Also, try breaking down longer sentences and adding more emotion (like, love, enjoy). Practice describing the same topics in the past tense (e.g., using 'used to') to improve grammar naturally.
