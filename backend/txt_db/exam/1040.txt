Question 
Describe the restaurants in your country. Where are they usually located? When do they open and close? What do they look like?

Answer 
Restaurants in my country are incredibly diverse. You can find them everywhere, from busy city centers and shopping malls to quiet suburban streets and even small alleys. Their operating hours vary greatly; many open for lunch around 11 or 12 and close after dinner, maybe around 9 or 10 PM. However, in big cities, many restaurants, especially bars and cafes, stay open much later, some even 24/7. Their appearance also differs widely. We have everything from fancy, modern restaurants with sleek designs to traditional eateries with classic architecture and decor, and casual places like food courts or street food stalls. The look often depends on the type of cuisine and the target customers.

Feedback 
This is a comprehensive description of restaurants. You covered location, hours, and appearance, highlighting the diversity. Using phrases like 'incredibly diverse', 'everywhere, from... to...', and 'vary greatly' adds detail and nuance. You provided specific examples for locations and hours ('busy city centers', 'shopping malls', 'small alleys', 'around 11 or 12', 'around 9 or 10 PM', '24/7'). Describing the appearance with examples like 'fancy, modern', 'traditional eateries', 'classic architecture', 'casual places', and 'street food stalls' is very effective. Your concluding sentence about the look depending on cuisine and customers is a good summary point.
