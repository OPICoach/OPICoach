Question 
Please describe the company that young people want to work at in detail. How has it developed from the past to now?

Answer 
As I told you before, many young people including myself want to work at Samsung. Samsung makes cell phones and home appliance. You can buy the products all over the world. And I think this is how the company has developed by exporting the products. (Company description and development strategy) Once, I went to India for traveling. So I saw Samsung products in a shopping mall. So it was amazing to see Korean products sold in India. (Personal example) And Samsung has recently released a new cell phone which is foldable. I think it's amazing. (Recent development) So I hope the company develops more in the future. And I really really want to work at Samsung in the near future. (Future hope and concluding remark)

Feedback 
Start by referencing the previous answer using 'As I told you before.' Describe the company's main products (cell phones, home appliance). Explain its development through global export. Provide a personal example to make your story more authentic and extend the answer. Mention recent developments, like new products (foldable phones). Use phrases like 'recently released.' Emphasize words by repeating them, like 'really really,' which sounds more natural. Optional 'fun points' can be added, such as mentioning owning company stocks ('I do have Samsung stocks... So I hope Samsung develops a lot in the future.') or using a competitor's product ('But actually I don't use Samsung products. I use LG products. Do you know LG? They are competitor of Samsung.'). Remember to maintain a conversational tone without using inappropriate language. Practice speaking out loud with an object (like a doll) as if having a conversation. Focus on understanding the strategy rather than rote memorization. Be energetic and cheerful.
