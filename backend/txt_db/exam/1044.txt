Question 
In your background, you indicated that you like to walk. How often do you usually go walking? Where do you like to walk? Please describe your routine in detail.

Answer 
Whenever I have time, I enjoy walking. I usually go with my friends or family. My favorite place to walk is Park. This is because it's really big and has amazing view. I prefer to go walking in the morning when the sun is up. Walking in the sunlight makes me feel really active and lively. What's more, walking gives me a chance to spend time with my family and friends. I love walking.

Feedback 
The question asks about your walking routine in detail. Pay attention to 'usually' which indicates a present tense routine. Use the 5W1H principle (who, where, when, what) to structure your answer. Key phrases include: 'Whenever I have time', 'enjoy walking' (note: enjoy + -ing), 'go with my friends or family', 'My favorite place to walk is...', 'because it's really big and has amazing view', 'I prefer to go walking' (note: go walking, not go *to* walking), 'in the morning when the sun is up', 'Walking in the sunlight makes me feel really active and lively', 'What's more', 'gives me a chance to spend time with...', 'I love walking' (can be used as a natural closing). Ensure correct pronunciation of 'walking' (워킹) vs 'working' (워킹).
