Question 
As a walker, what items do you use or wear when you go walking? What safety precautions do you take to avoid injury?

Answer 
I'm a light packer. A water bottle is a must to keep myself hydrated. I also do a lot of stretching not to get a cramp in my leg. I wear comfortable shoes and clothes.

This question asks about items you use/wear and safety precautions. It's a mixed-type question. Use present tense. Useful expressions include: 'I'm a light packer' (I pack lightly), 'A is a must' (A is essential), 'keep myself hydrated' (stay hydrated), 'get a cramp' (get a muscle cramp), 'do a lot of stretching', 'not to get a cramp', 'avoid injury' (prevent injury), 'safety precaution'.
