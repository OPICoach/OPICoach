Question 
You indicated in the survey that you like to walk. Why did you first become interested in it? Describe in detail.

Answer 
Initially, I wasn't interested in exercise at all. I used to be a couch potato and enjoyed drinking beer. But one day, something shocking happened. My clothes didn't fit anymore. What happened really blew my mind. So, I decided to start exercising. That's how I first became interested in walking. I started walking for short distances and gradually increased the time and distance. As a result, I lost some weight and felt much healthier. Now, my body shape is much better.

Feedback 
This question asks about the reason you first became interested in walking. 'First become interested' indicates you must use the past tense to describe the initial event and process. Use a story structure: initial state (not interested, couch potato), triggering event (shocking event like clothes not fitting - 'What happened really blew my mind'), the decision to start, the process of starting (walking short distances), and the result/effect (lost weight, felt healthier - use present tense for current results). Ensure consistent use of past tense for past events.
