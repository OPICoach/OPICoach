Question 
You indicated in the survey that you enjoy going to concerts. Tell me about a concert that you have been to recently. Where was the concert held and who did you go with? Did you enjoy the concert?

Answer 
Recently, I went to a concert given by BTS. BTS is a popular boy band in Korea who became famous all over the world because of the song called DNA. I'm a big fan of this group. I was lucky because my friend asked me to go with her. It was held at the Stadium, which is located in Seoul. BTS songs are really active and lively. So, I sang along to songs and moved to the music. The concert made me feel full of energy. I will never forget that evening.

Feedback 
This question asks about a recent concert experience. 'Recently' and the past tense questions ('Where was... held', 'who did you go with', 'Did you enjoy') mean you must use the past tense. Use the 5W1H principle for a past routine/experience: when (recently), who (with my friend), where (at the stadium in Seoul), what happened/what you did (sang along, moved to the music). Describe the artist and the atmosphere. Key phrases: 'Recently, I went to a concert given by...', describe the artist ('popular boy band', 'became famous'), explain how you went ('lucky because my friend asked me to go with her'), describe the venue ('It was held at...', 'which is located in...'), describe the music/atmosphere ('active and lively'), describe your actions (use past tense: 'sang along to songs', 'moved to the music'), describe how you felt ('made me feel full of energy'), conclude ('I will never forget that evening').
