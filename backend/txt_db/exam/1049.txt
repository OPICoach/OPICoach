Question 
Which theater or auditorium do you like the most? Where is it? What do you like about it? Tell me about a show that you have seen at this venue.

Answer 
My favorite venue for concerts is the Concert Hall. It's close to my house, within a 5-minute walking distance. What I like about it is that it has state-of-the-art facilities. The sound system is amazing, and the seating is very comfortable. Also, the staff members are always very friendly and helpful. Their service really lives up to my expectations. I recently saw a musical there, and the experience was fantastic thanks to the great venue.

Feedback 
This question asks about your favorite concert venue and why you like it. 'Which... do you like the most' and 'What do you like about it' require you to state your preference and provide reasons. Use the present tense as it's about your current preference. Describe the location and features. Key phrases: 'My favorite venue is...', 'It's close to my house', 'within a 5-minute walking distance', 'What I like about it is...', 'It has state-of-the-art facilities' (latest technology), 'lives up to my expectations' (meets my expectations). This is different from a pure description question ('What does it look like?').
