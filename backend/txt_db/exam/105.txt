Question 
Tell me about your trip to England and France. Which did you like better and why? Did you visit restaurants in England? How was the food? What Korean food do you like?

Answer 
I liked England more because my friend lived there and I could read the sentences everywhere. Yes, I visited many kind of restaurant. The food was not very delicious, they were not good condition, not salty. I like Korean pizza because there are many ingredients over there, unlike foreign countries where they don't put many things on the pizza.

Feedback 
You are IH but closer to IM2. Your answers can be complicated; try to make them simpler and clearer. For example, 'I visited many kind of restaurant' should be 'I visited many kinds of restaurants' or 'I visited a lot of restaurants'. Pay attention to S grammar (plural forms). For AL, add more emotion and explain the 'so what?' part â€“ how you felt about the food or experiences, not just stating facts.
