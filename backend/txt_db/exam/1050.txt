Question 
You indicated in the survey that you go to concerts. Tell me about the types of concerts you enjoy attending. How often do you go to concerts and with whom do you usually go?

Answer 
I usually enjoy attending K-pop concerts and rock concerts. I prefer lively music that makes me feel active. Listening to this kind of music helps me let off some steam. I think I go to concerts about once or twice a month. I usually go with my friends. We love singing along to the songs and moving to the music together. It's a great way to relieve stress and have fun.
