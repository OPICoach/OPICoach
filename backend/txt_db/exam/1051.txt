Feedback 
This question asks you to describe a park you often visit. Listen for keywords like 'which park', 'where is it', and 'describe in detail'. This is a description question, use the present tense. The provided script is an example of an IM level answer - relatively short but covers the basics. Key phrases: 'My favorite park is...', 'It's close to my house' (a versatile phrase for location), 'I like going there to + verb', 'has many facilities', 'such as' (for examples), 'makes me clear my head' (helps me relax/destress). Focus on natural delivery even with a short script.
