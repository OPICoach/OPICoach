Question 
How often do you go to the park or beach? Who do you usually go with? What do you like to do?

Answer 
My all time number one park is Park. I think I go there once a week. I also go there whenever I'm stressed out. I usually go there with my neighbor, [Neighbor's Name]. We go there in the evening when the sun sets. When we get there, we take a walk for an hour to talk about our day and current events. Then, we sit down on a bench and admire the view. Oh, we sometimes have chicken and beer. The taste is always beyond my expectations. I love Park.

This question asks about your park/beach routine (can be adapted for beach). Listen for 'How often', 'Who do you usually go with', 'What do you like to do', and 'usually'. This is a present tense routine question. The provided script is an example of an IH level answer - longer and uses more varied expressions than IM. Structure using 5W1H. Key phrases: 'My all time number one park is...' (my absolute favorite), 'I think I go there once a week' (frequency), 'whenever I'm stressed out' (when I'm stressed), 'with my neighbor', 'in the evening when the sun sets' (or 'in the morning when the sun is up'), 'When we get there', 'take a walk for an hour', 'talk about our day and current events', 'sit down on a bench', 'admire the view', 'beyond my expectations' (exceeds my expectations), 'I love Park' (express with emotion). Practice delivering this conversationally.
