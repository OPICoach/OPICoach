Answer 
IH Level Answer:
Yes. I always prefer to stay at home during vacations. So I'd like to tell you about what I normally do when I spend my vacation at home.
As soon as my vacation starts, I just chill out, listening to music. I listen to a lot of music and take a nap during my vacation. Sometimes, I binge watch movies and TV shows on Netflix. I feel like I can escape from my stress while watching my favorite TV shows.
And I also like to invite the people around me to my place. When my friends visit me, I usually prepare food for them. I think it's a lot of fun to cook for someone. It makes me happy. Besides, I always love to spend time talking to my friends and family during vacations.
So all in all, a vacation at home is a perfect way for me to relieve stress. I'd have to say my apartment is the best place to spend my vacation. Obviously, you know, I'm such a home body. So how about you Eva? Do you stay home during vacations?
