IH Level Answer:
Let me tell you about my last vacation at home. It was in December last year. I mean yeah last year. I invited my best friend Jenna to my place and we had a great time together.
Actually, she came over to my place in the morning. So we had some coffee, relaxed and watch some TV shows on Netflix. It was really fun. It was really fun to watch our favorite TV shows together all morning.
Then later that day, I cooked dinner for her. I made potato pizza and she really liked it. Honestly, it was my first time making pizza, but it was pretty good. So imagine eating homemade pizza with your best friend at home. It was just perfect.
Um I think it was such a memorable vacation. And I can't wait for my next vacation. Eva, would you like to hang out sometime? Maybe I can invite you to my place for my next vacation.
