AL Level Answer:
Let me tell you about the last time I stayed home for my vacation. It's when my best friend Jenna came to visit me in December last year. I remember she and I had tons of fun together.
So I called Jenna over to my place in the morning. She and I had some coffee together and watched an entire season of our favorite TV show on Netflix. Anyway, it was really fun to just chill out binge watching. I guess we totally enjoyed being a couch potato throughout the morning.
Then later in the afternoon, I cooked a special dinner for her. Actually, my friend Jenna is a big time foodie. So I wanted to cook something special. I made pizza and lasagna for the first time and they tasted really good. She was impressed with the dinner and of course we ate a lot.
Anyway, I think I'd have to say it was such a fun and memorable vacation. Oh one more thing. Jenna said she'll invite me to her place for her next vacation. And I'm really looking forward to hanging out with her. So Eva, if you're interested, you're welcome to join us.
