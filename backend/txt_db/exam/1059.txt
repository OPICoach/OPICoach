Question 
Tell me about where you live. What does it look like? How many rooms does it have? Describe your home in detail.

Answer 
I live in an apartment building in the city. It's not a very new building, but it's well-maintained. My apartment is on the fifth floor. It's a decent size for one person. It has a living room, a kitchen, one bedroom, and one bathroom. So, that's four rooms in total, not counting the hallway. The living room is where I spend most of my time. It has a comfortable sofa, a TV, and a small table. The kitchen is small but functional; I can cook simple meals there. My bedroom is cozy, with just enough space for my bed and a wardrobe. The bathroom is pretty standard. I like my apartment because it's quiet and gets a lot of natural light, especially in the afternoon. It feels like a comfortable and personal space.

Your description of your apartment is clear and provides good detail. You use appropriate vocabulary like 'well-maintained,' 'decent size,' 'functional,' and 'cozy.' The structure, moving from the building to the specific rooms, is easy to follow. To add more variety to your sentences, you could try combining some short sentences or starting sentences in different ways. For example, instead of several sentences starting with 'It has...' or 'It's...', you could say 'Inside, you'll find a living room, a kitchen, a bedroom, and a bathroom.' or 'Although the kitchen is small, it's quite functional.' Using phrases like 'reasonably sized' instead of 'decent size' or 'fairly typical' instead of 'pretty standard' can also slightly elevate your vocabulary. Overall, it's a solid description.
