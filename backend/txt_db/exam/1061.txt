Question 
Banks have definitely changed over time. Tell me about a bank you remember from your childhood. What did the bank look like? How was it different from banks today?

Answer 
Okay, banks. Well, let me give it to you straight. I think they're just so tiny these days. But that's what's just so amazing about them because they fit right in my phone. It's all about online banking. And I love that. Well, back in the days, like when I was a child, I followed my mom everywhere, even to banks. And of course, we had no choice, right? We had to physically go to a bank because there was no such a thing as a smartphone, apps, online banking, none of that existed. And so it was very annoying having to wait in long lineups, you know? And ah, just so frustrating. But these days, my goodness, we're living in the future. That's for sure. You don't feel like going to a bank? You don't feel like waiting in long lineups? No problem. Let technology take care of you. All we have to do is turn on our phones the way we usually do, go to our bank app, and voila. We can do whatever we want. So easy, so painless. Just puts a smile on my face every time. I am a huge fan of technology because of this. And you know what? Let's see what the future has in store for us. Who knows? Maybe later, we can go to our banks by using our minds. That's what I'm looking forward to.

Feedback 
This answer effectively uses the comparison strategy by focusing on the present first, then the past, and returning to the present. Key expressions like 'let me give it to you straight' are great for starting honestly. Highlighting the contrast between 'tiny but amazing' banks today (fitting in a phone) and the past (physically going, long lineups) is a strong point. Using phrases like 'it's all about online banking' shows emphasis. The past section effectively conveys negative feelings ('annoying', 'frustrating') with sound effects ('ah') and fillers ('you know?') for naturalness. The present section uses positive expressions ('living in the future', 'so easy, so painless', 'puts a smile on my face') and repetition ('You don't feel like...'). The suggestion to remove 'you' from 'You don't feel like' makes it smoother. 'Let technology take care of you' is a good personification. 'All we have to do' is a useful phrase. 'Voila' adds a nice touch. The conclusion uses excellent forward-looking expressions like 'Let's see what the future has in store for us' and 'That's what I'm looking forward to', along with 'Who knows?' for uncertainty. The clear contrast between the past (no online banking, annoying/frustrating) and present (online banking, easy/painless) is well-demonstrated throughout the answer.
