Question 
What kind of activities do children do at a park? How are they different from what adults do? Please compare the activities that children do with the ones that adults do at a park. Please give me all the details.

Answer 
This question is a bit tricky to answer. I think it's probably because the activities um kids and adults do at the park aren't all that different. I think the main reason people go to park is to spend time in nature. Especially in beautiful seasons like spring, you know, people had to um had to the park to enjoy scenery. Um go for walks, like ride bikes and have picnics with family and friends.

Starting with 'This question is a bit tricky to answer' and acknowledging similarity ('aren't all that different') is a good strategy. Use 'the main reason people go to park is to...'. Avoid strong stress on the verb 'is'. Use fillers like 'you know', 'um', 'like'. 'Had to' is an alternative to 'go to'. Use 'veggies' for vegetables in casual conversation. Use 'a variety of' or 'a huge variety of' instead of repetitive 'so many kinds of'.
