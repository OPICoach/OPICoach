Question 
The use of the internet can vary by generation. How do your parents' generation and your generation utilize the internet differently? Please discuss the biggest differences in internet usage between senior citizens and young people.

Answer 
This question is a bit tricky to answer. The reason is that there isn't much of a big difference between how my parents generation and my generation use the internet. You know, nowadays most websites have like mobile apps. You know making it super easy to use their services through apps. You just need to touch a few tabs on the screen. Of course there can be senior citizens who find using the internet challenging. But overall it seems like everyone is pretty savvy with it. Oh one big difference just popped into my head ever. I think younger people tend to share their lives more on social media through the internet. Also young people tend to share more videos on the internet internet platforms like YouTube. But you know these days like there are also plenty of senior YouTubers. So um I think there aren't really big noticeable differences by generation when it comes to internet use.

Starting with 'This question is a bit tricky to answer' and stating there isn't 'much of a big difference' is a valid approach. Use vocabulary like 'mobile apps'. Using 'super' (e.g., 'super easy') is acceptable informal language in OPIc. 'Touch a few tabs on the screen' is a good descriptive phrase for phone usage. Use 'challenging' as an alternative to 'difficult'. 'Savvy' is a useful word (e.g., 'tech savvy', 'fashion savvy'). 'Popped into my head' is a natural way to introduce a sudden thought. 'Tend to...' is useful for describing habits or inclinations. Pay attention to the pronunciation of possessives like 'their' (their lives, not there lives). 'Noticeable differences' is good vocabulary. Avoid stressing the preposition 'to'.
