This is a description question. Focus on key geographical features like mountains, rivers, lakes, coastlines, and islands. You can mention that Korea is a peninsula, faces the sea on three sides, is largely mountainous (e.g., 70-80%), and has many islands. Avoid using up all your travel-related answers here, as a travel topic might follow.
