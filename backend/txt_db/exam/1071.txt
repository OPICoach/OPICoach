Question 
I'd like to know about any special occasions or holidays you have celebrated with your friends or family. Please tell me which occasion you celebrated with them and what activities you did together.

Answer 
Option 1 (Acknowledging similarity/difficulty): Wow um this test is more difficult than I thought. I just mentioned celebrating my mom's birthday which was like the last special occasion I celebrated with my family. I'm honestly even when I celebrate birthdays with my friends it's kind of feels the same. So we eat together spend time and exchange gift you know. Whether it's a holiday you know what a birthday it all feels pretty similar. So I don't know what to say. I hope this answer works for your question. I didn't expect so many similar questions to keep popping up. Option 2 (Different answer - Travel): My parents were tired of preparing all the holiday dishes. So um we decided to travel. We didn't do anything special like tours and activities. We just found nice places to eat talked a lot and got some real rest. So you know my sister especially was thrilled to get a break from work. She said she wanted to relax and blow off some steam during the holiday.

Feedback 
It's common for similar questions to appear. Practice acknowledging this and stating difficulty (Option 1). Phrases: 'this test is more difficult than I thought', 'I just mentioned...', 'it all feels pretty similar', 'I don't know what to say', 'I hope this answer works for your question', 'I didn't expect so many similar questions to keep popping up'. Use comparatives ('more difficult than'). If giving a different answer (Option 2), focus on the experience and use varied vocabulary. Vocabulary: 'tired of' (vs 'sick of'), 'thrilled' (instead of just 'happy'), 'get a break from work', 'blow off some steam', 'works for you', 'keep popping up'. Ensure past tense is used correctly. Practice passing or keeping answers short when questions overlap significantly. Practice mock tests to prepare for overlapping questions.
