Question 
What is the most famous and promising business in the city where you live? Why has this business become well known, and what is its biggest characteristic? Please explain in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
I would say the most well known business in my city is the tourism industry. I'm not an expert in this field but I will do my best to explain what I know. As far as I know, there is so much to do in Seoul. You can watch like performances, visit historical sites, or like go to amusement parks. Besides, there are also tons of beautiful parks along the river called the Han river. You know, one of the things to do is like ride a bike along the river. On top of that, I've heard that one of the things tourists enjoy the most is Korean food. Unlike Western food, you know, Korean meals include like a main dish, like very side dishes, rice, and like soup all at once. You know, let me tell you a bit more about like Korean side dishes. They're served in generous portions and like made with lots of veggies, I think, making the meals like well balanced. And most importantly, they are like super tasty, you know. Anyway, I think the most famous business where I live is probably the tourism industry.

Use "I would say" to start your answer. Use contractions like "is" in "my city is" (should be pronounced quickly, not dragged out). Use filler phrases like "you know" or "I mean" when pausing, but don't drag them out. The phrase "I'm not an expert in this field but I will do my best to explain what I know" is a versatile phrase for difficult questions. "As far as I know" is useful. Use "there is so much to do" (more colloquial) instead of "there are so many things to do". Use informal quantifiers like "tons of" or "a lot of". Practice sentence patterns like "one of the things to do is like...". Avoid repetitive patterns like "I usually do...". Learn phrases like "on top of that" instead of always using "also", "besides", or "plus". Use the present perfect "I've heard that" to talk about what you've heard over time. Practice patterns like "one of the things tourists enjoy the most is...". Use phrases like "Unlike Western food" for comparisons. Learn vocabulary for food components like "main dish", "side dishes", "rice", "soup". Use phrases like "Let me tell you a bit more about..." for elaboration. Practice using "served in generous portions" and "made with lots of veggies". Use adjectives like "well balanced" and adverbs like "most importantly". Use colloquial adjectives like "super tasty". Avoid ending abruptly; use fillers like "you know, like anyway" before concluding.
