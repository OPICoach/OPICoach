Question 
What is the most memorable interview you have had so far? What job was it for? What made that interview so memorable?

Answer 
I don't think there was a particularly like memorable interview for me. I tend to get nervous, so interviews always has been like stressful for me, nerve racking for me. However, there was like, you know, one interview I had, you know, and it stands out in my memory. When I had other interviews, the interviewers often had like a rude or like aggressive attitude. They made it very clear that they weren't interested in me. So I got even like more nervous and ended up messing up the interview. But, you know, when I had an interview for a part time job, you know, in my senior year of college. The interviewer was very polite and asked me really good questions. He listened attentively to my answers and I usually get very nervous during interviews, but that day I felt really comfortable and I think I answered really well. Even though interviews are usually stressful and not enjoyable, that one was really great.

Use phrases like "I don't think there was a particularly memorable interview" to start if no single one stands out immediately. Use "I tend to get nervous" to describe a tendency. Use vocabulary like "stressful" or the higher-level "nerve racking". Learn the phrase "it stands out in my memory". Use descriptive adjectives like "rude" or "aggressive". Learn the phrase "They made it very clear that...". Practice using "ended up + -ing" (e.g., "ended up messing up the interview"). Use time phrases like "in my senior year of college". Use adjectives like "polite", "kind". Use adverbs like "attentively". Practice describing feelings like "felt really comfortable". Use comparative structures like "Even though... that one was...". Focus on using past tense correctly for recounting the experience.
