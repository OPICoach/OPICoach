Question 
Tell me about the bank you often go to. What is it like? Where is it located? And what hours is it open? Talk about it in details.

Answer 
The bank I often visit. Well, I have to say this is a hard one because I hardly visit a bank. Honestly, I prefer to use online banking service. You know, it's easier to care of things with my phone using mobile banking. So I don't really have to go to a bank. So I guess I can tell you about the banks in my country. As far as I know, there are about six major banks to choose from. And basically, banks and ATMs are all over the place in my city. It's probably because I live in downtown area in Seoul. The banks in my country are typically open from 9am until 4pm. Honestly though, I'm not quite sure because I rarely visit a bank. I don't remember the last time I went to a bank. Let me tell you about what the banks in my country look like. If you go inside a bank, you'll see a customer lobby and windows with bankers. And also, there are several ATMs outside each bank branch. Oh, one more thing. The employees are always very knowledgeable and kind. And I love their great service. Overall, the banks in my country are pretty much the same as the banks in other countries. Yes, I guess that's all.

Feedback 
This is a sample answer for the difficult 돌발 (돌발) topic 'Banks', specifically addressing the question about describing a frequently visited bank. The answer starts with a natural filler and expresses the difficulty of the question, explaining that the speaker rarely visits a physical bank due to preferring online/mobile banking.
