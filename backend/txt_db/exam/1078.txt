Question 
Tell me about a healthy person you know. What does he or she look like? And what kind of food does he or she eat?

Answer 
Oh okay. A healthy person I know. Hmm. Let's see. I haven't really thought about it. I mean, I guess I can say I am a healthy person. But let me tell you about one of my best friends Jenny. Jenny is probably one of the healthiest people around me. So speaking of her appearance, I would say she's such a pretty girl. Jenny has big beautiful eyes and so she's really photogenic. Also, she's really fit. Yeah, she's in a good shape. I mean her arms and legs are so skinny. I would say she's got slim muscles which makes her look so fit. Oh and you know what? Jenny always eats healthy and drinks a lot of water. Yeah, she keeps a balanced diet with lots of fruits and vegetables. On top of that, she goes to the gym like almost every day. Well, I have to say I'm impressed with her lifestyle, especially with her persistence. Well, speaking of which, I feel like I need to eat better and work out more often. Maybe I should call Jenny.

Feedback 
This answer effectively addresses the prompt by describing a healthy person, their appearance, and their eating habits/lifestyle. The introduction uses filler phrases ('Oh okay', 'Hmm. Let's see', 'I haven't really thought about it', 'I mean, I guess', 'Well') to sound natural and buy time. It correctly uses 'one of + plural noun' ('one of my best friends') and 'probably' for probability. The appearance section uses 'speaking of' for topic transition, intensifiers ('such a', 'so'), and relevant vocabulary ('photogenic', 'fit', 'in a good shape', 'skinny', 'slim muscles', 'She's got'). The lifestyle section uses 'And you know what?' for transition, correctly applies the 3rd person singular 's' to verbs ('eats', 'drinks', 'keeps', 'goes'), and uses phrases like 'keeps a balanced diet', 'lots of fruits and vegetables', and 'On top of that'. It also includes expressions like 'I have to say I'm impressed with' and vocabulary like 'persistence'. The conclusion uses 'speaking of which' for a smooth transition back to the main topic/personal reflection and 'I feel like' to express opinion, ending with a light remark. The structure (Intro-Body1-Body2-Conclusion) is clear and easy to follow. The vocabulary and grammatical structures used are appropriate for intermediate to advanced levels.
