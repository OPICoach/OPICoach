Question 
Have you ever had any problems with your home? What was the problem and how did you deal with it? How did the problem turn out? Give me as many details as possible.

Answer 
Honestly, I haven't had many problems with my home because I don't spend much time at home. Now that I think about it, I remember a time when there was water leaking from the toilet. Um, I vividly remember the day though it was a few years ago. So one day, I woke up on a Saturday morning and found the bathroom flooded with water. A big problem I had that morning was a leaking toilet. I searched for the root of the problem and noticed there was water leaking from my toilet. It was so frustrating that I couldn't use the bathroom because it was totally flooded. It was such a mess. So I couldn't fix it, I called a plumber and requested an appointment. When the plumber arrived, he was able to fix the leak right away. The problem was solved, but I still had to deal with the flooded apartment. Um, I remember it took several hours to clean everything up. You can't imagine how exhausted I was by the time I was done cleaning my apartment. So I would say it was a memorable but crazy experience that I had with my home. I feel like I should learn how to fix the toilet. You know, I'd better prevent this kind of situation from ever happening again.

This is a very well-structured and detailed answer that effectively addresses the question about a problem at home. You successfully followed a logical flow, starting with an introduction, describing the problem situation in detail, explaining the solution, and concluding with your feelings and lessons learned. Your use of varied tenses is excellent â€“ you correctly used the present perfect ('haven't had') for general experience, past tense ('woke up', 'found', 'called', etc.) for the narrative, and present tense ('don't spend', 'feel like') for current states or reflections. This demonstrates strong grammatical control, which is key for higher OPIc levels. You provided specific and descriptive details, using good vocabulary like 'flooded with water', 'root of the problem', 'frustrating', 'such a mess', and 'exhausted'. Phrases like 'was able to fix' and 'deal with' add variety to your language. The concluding sentences about learning to fix the toilet and preventing future problems add a thoughtful touch. Overall, this is a strong, detailed, and well-delivered response.
