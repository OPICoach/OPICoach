Question 
The text discusses the nature of OPIc questions, stating there could be millions, which are reduced by survey topic selection, though still potentially numbering around 1,000. It notes that questions can be general or specific, about oneself or others, and unexpected (돌발) questions can still appear regardless of survey choices.

Answer 
The text advises against memorizing scripts due to the large number of potential questions. It suggests being honest when selecting survey topics and focusing on answering questions about topics you are genuinely interested in. It recommends using the instructor's 'four categories strategy' to be able to answer any question and emphasizes focusing on natural conversation flow and smoothness over perfection.

Feedback 
The main feedback is that the common strategy of selecting 'nothing' in the survey, while reducing the question pool, still leaves too many questions to memorize answers for and doesn't necessarily make questions easier. The recommended strategy is honesty in topic selection, which allows for more natural and engaging answers based on personal interest and experience. This approach is seen as more effective for achieving a good OPIc score and, more importantly, for improving general English conversation ability, which the instructor prioritizes.
