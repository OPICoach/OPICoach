Question 
In your background, you indicated that you like to jog. How often do you usually go jogging? Where do you like to go? Please describe your routine in detail.

Answer 
I normally go jogging once a week. I also go whenever I'm stressed out. I usually go with my friends or family, but when they're busy, I go there by myself. When I get there, I jog for an hour. It helps me feel refreshed. And then, I sit on a bench and admire the view. After that, I eat at a convenience store. I can buy chicken, beer, and so on. Having chicken and beer after jogging is a best thing to do, I think. Jogging is a great stress reliever.

Feedback 
The question asks about frequency (How often), location (Where), and routine (Please describe your routine in detail). 'Usually' indicates the present tense is required. 'Routine' implies describing the typical process (who, what, where, when, how). Useful patterns for frequency include 'I normally X once a week' and 'I also go whenever I'm stressed out'. 'I'm stressed out' is the correct phrase for feeling stressed. For who you go with, 'I usually go with my friends or family, but when they're busy, I go there by myself' is a versatile pattern. 'When I get there' is a good phrase to start describing the routine upon arrival. Setting a fixed time like 'for an hour' is helpful. Avoid 'I jogging'; use 'I jog'. The structure 'It helps me feel refreshed' uses the 'help A B' pattern. Connectors like 'And then' and 'After that' improve flow. 'Admire the view' is a good phrase for enjoying scenery. 'Eat at a convenience store' is specific and relatable. When listing items, you can use 'and so on' for 'etc.'. 'Having chicken and beer after jogging is a best thing to do' is a descriptive phrase, and 'I think' is a common filler. 'Jogging is a great stress reliever' is a good concluding statement about the benefit. This script can be adapted for similar topics like hiking or walking by changing specific words (e.g., 'jogging' to 'hiking', 'jog' to 'hike', 'park' to 'mountain'). Practice speaking quickly and conversationally ('부음부음 빠르게').
