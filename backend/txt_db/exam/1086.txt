Question 
As a jogger, what items do you use or wear when you go jogging? What safety precautions do you take to avoid injury?

Answer 
I take several things when I go jogging. First, I take my cell phone. Jogging while listening to music helps me be more active. Oh, and a water bottle is a must when I jog. I drink water whenever I'm thirsty. I wear a track suit and running shoes. As for safety precautions, I do a lot of stretching. Oh, and I make sure to watch out for cyclists because it is sometimes dangerous.

Feedback 
This question combines two types: describing items/objects and describing safety precautions. Both require the present tense. The phrase 'I take several things when I go jogging' is a good opener for listing items. Avoid 'go to jogging'; use 'go jogging'. 'Jogging while listening to music helps me be more active' uses the 'help A B' pattern. 'Oh, and' adds a conversational tone. 'A water bottle is a must' is a useful pattern ('X is a must' means X is essential). Practice the pronunciation of 'water bottle' with rising-falling intonation. 'Thirsty' requires a 'th' sound. 'Track suit' (not 'shoot') or 'sports wear' are options for training clothes. 'Running shoes' is standard for athletic shoes. Transitioning to safety precautions, 'As for safety precautions' is a good phrase meaning 'regarding safety precautions'. 'I do a lot of stretching' is a common safety measure. 'I make sure to watch out for X' means 'I am careful about X'. 'Cyclists' is a good alternative to 'bike rider'. Ending with a reason like 'because it is sometimes dangerous' adds detail. Remember that even a slightly shorter answer is acceptable if delivered clearly and conversationally with good intonation and gestures.
