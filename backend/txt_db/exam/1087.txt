Feedback 
This question asks about the reasons and feelings associated with walking ('Why do you walk?' and 'How does walking make you feel?'). It essentially asks why walking is beneficial or enjoyable. The opening 'There are several reasons why I like walking' is a solid structure. Avoid 'working'; use 'walking'. 'Helps my blood circulation' is a health benefit. 'Gives me time to meditate' describes a mental benefit; 'meditate' means to clear one's mind. 'There is another important reason' is a good phrase to introduce another point, acting as a filler or connector. 'I believe that' is another common filler. 'It's a good way to stay fit' describes maintaining physical condition. 'Fit' means toned or in good shape. Emphasize speaking quickly and conversationally ('부음부음 빠르게'), using hand gestures and smiling to convey positive energy and improve delivery. This script can be easily adapted for jogging or hiking by changing the main verb/noun. Ending abruptly is acceptable, but an optional closing like 'I love walking' can be used on some questions.
