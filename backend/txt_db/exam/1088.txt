Question 
Have you made any changes to your home? What kinds of changes have you made? Are you satisfied with the changes? Give me all the details.

Answer 
Okay. Honestly, I can't think of any changes I made to my home. This is because I live in a small apartment and there is not a lot of space anyway. Personally, I don't really enjoy making changes to my place. Well, maybe I can tell you about the things I bought for my apartment. Um, a few months ago, I got a new kitchen table. I already had an old table, but I didn't like its color and design. So I bought a new kitchen table from IKEA. And I love it. It was about $100, which was a good buy I think. Oh, and its beige color goes really well with the kitchen area. Oh, there is one more thing I'd like to talk about. It's a new coffee machine I purchased last month. I bought this brand new coffee machine from Nespresso. And you know what? I put it on my favorite kitchen table and drink coffee there every morning. I feel like my kitchen has turned into a home cafe now. So anyway, I'd have to say my apartment is such a cozy home. Although I haven't made a lot of changes to my apartment, I'm so happy with what it's like now. Yeah, well, I guess that's it.

Feedback 
This answer effectively combines the 'Changes to Home' and 'Furniture/Appliances' topics. Good use of fillers ('Honestly', 'Well', 'Um', 'Oh', 'And you know what?', 'Yeah, well') for natural flow. The introduction provides a reason for not making major changes ('small apartment', 'not a lot of space', 'don't really enjoy making changes'). The body details specific purchases (kitchen table, coffee machine) using varied verbs ('got', 'bought', 'purchased') and past tense correctly. Including details like brand ('IKEA', 'Nespresso'), price ('about $100'), and opinion ('good buy') adds richness. Descriptive phrases like 'goes really well with' and 'brand new' are effective. The transition 'one more thing I'd like to talk about' is smooth. Combining past action ('put it on') and present habit ('drink coffee') in one sentence is good. The sentence 'I feel like my kitchen has turned into a home cafe now' uses a more complex structure (feel like + sentence) and present perfect ('has turned into'), suitable for higher levels. The conclusion uses a good transition ('So anyway') and expresses satisfaction with the current state ('I'd have to say', 'such a cozy home', 'happy with what it's like now'). The use of 'Although' clause adds complexity. Ending with 'I guess that's it' is a simple wrap-up. Pay attention to pronunciation ('purchased') and ensuring consistent use of past tense for past events.
