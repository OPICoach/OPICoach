Question 
Where and how often do you go jogging? How do you feel after jogging?

Answer 
에바. There is my favorite park near my place. Seoul Forest is the best place to enjoy my leisure time. Not surprisingly, I go jogging there and get some fresh air. There are gorgeous fountains and walking trails at the park. It has a peaceful lake with various plant. On weekend I go jogging with my friends. Bumming around and staying at home make me chubby. After jogging, I feel much more energetic and relaxed. Jogging with my dog at the park is my number one stress reliever. To sum up, that's my jogging routine.
