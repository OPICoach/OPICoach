Question 
Do you have any memorable experience while jogging?

Answer 
에바야, 말을 계속 거세요. This question is one of the most interesting questions I have I've been asked. There are various community festivals and events. Last time I went to Seoul Jogging Festival. I remember the time when I saw a deer and rabbits there. It surprised me a lot. At that very moment. as an animal lover, I have a soft spot for animals. They were so small, adorable and lovely. But I heard feeding wild animals is generally a bad idea. Then I just took a picture and let them go. Anyway, this is my most memorable jogging experience.

This question asks for a memorable experience, requiring the past tense. Key points: 1. Use past tense verbs consistently. 2. Memorable experience questions are common (often 3-4 per test), so prepare stories. 3. Connect this experience to other topics like family time, vacations, holidays, or festivals/events (돌발 문제). For example, this story can be used if asked about a memorable festival or event. 4. Use stress (강세) on important words like adjectives, nouns, and verbs (형용사, 명사, 동사 - 형명동) to sound natural and expressive. 5. Speak naturally, not stiffly. Don't force complex grammar if it doesn't come naturally. 6. Practice using non-human subjects like 'It surprised me a lot'. 7. Describe your feelings and emotions using expressive adjectives ('small, adorable, lovely'). 8. Use association (연상법) to remember the storyline (e.g., visualize the festival, seeing the animals, taking the picture). 9. Prepare the content/story beforehand and focus on speaking fluently during the test. 10. Learn useful expressions like 'have a soft spot for'.
