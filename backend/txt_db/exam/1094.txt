Question 
Clara, people make appointments for a variety of reasons. What kinds of appointments do you usually make with people? Who do you make them with?

Answer 
When I want to kill time, I make an appointment with my friends. This is because it's a great stress reliever. My routine is usually fixed. When I feel bored, I ask my friends to hang out. We usually go to a nearby restaurant and have chicken and beer while talking about our day. Our talk usually goes on and on for hours. It's so much fun to talk to my friends. Oh, and I also make appointments with a dental clinic. I go there once a year to get a regular check up. Going to a dental clinic is stressful, but I believe that it's a must. Last but not least, I also make appointment with my family for movie night. Whenever there is a movie to watch, I ask my family to go with me. Having family time is the highlight of my life. I love making appointments with my family and friends.
