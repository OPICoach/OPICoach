Question 
Clara, tell me about a particularly memorable appointment with your friends. What made this experience so unforgettable? Give me as many details as you can.

Answer 
A few years ago, I had a special experience that was so memorable. One day, my friend Sam and I went to a festival held at Han River Park. While enjoying the festival at a park, I got a call from my friend Clara. While talking about our day on the phone, I went to a convenience store to buy a drink. When I stopped by a convenience store, I saw Clara standing there. Can you believe it? I never thought that I would randomly see her at a festival. I went up to her and said hi. Of course, she was really surprised too. Today's day, we talk about it. It was a once in a lifetime experience.

Feedback 
This question asks about a memorable experience, so you must use the past tense. It's helpful to have a versatile script for experience questions that can be adapted. Structure your story with a clear beginning (when, who, where), the main event, the reaction, and a conclusion. Useful phrases include: 'A few years ago', 'I had a special experience that was so memorable', 'One day', 'went to a festival held at...', 'While + V-ing', 'got a call from...', 'While talking about...', 'went to a convenience store', 'When I stopped by...', 'I saw... standing there', 'Can you believe it?', 'I never thought that...', 'randomly', 'went up to her and said hi', 'Of course, she was really surprised too', 'Today's day, we talk about it', and 'It was a once in a lifetime experience'. Practice natural delivery, especially for phrases like 'Can you believe it?' and emphasizing 'so' ('so memorable').
