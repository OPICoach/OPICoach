Question 
Talk about the news you remember watching about homes people live in. How do people deal with that issue?

Answer 
Oh man, all right. So, homes, I have no idea about the market. My first house was in Korea. Uh so I never home shopped before. That's about it. I don't know anything else about homes.

Feedback 
The reaction 'Oh man, all right' is very native. 'All right' is particularly natural. Repeating main words like 'homes' shows thinking time. 'I have no idea about the market' is a natural way to express cluelessness, better than 'I don't know about'. Suggestion: use 'I have no clue' or 'I really have no idea'. An advanced technique is to use 'let alone watching it on the news' to control the question and dismiss the news part. Mentioning the first house in Korea and never home shopping explains lack of experience. The mistake 'house' instead of 'home' is minor; not self-correcting maintains flow, which is more important than perfect grammar. Ending with 'That's about it. I don't know anything else about homes' is natural, much better than 'That's it' or 'Thanks for listening'. For Q15 news, a suggested strategy is: 1. React (briefly). 2. Repeat main words. 3. Confirm cluelessness ('I have no idea/clue about...'). 4. Control the question by acknowledging the news part and dismissing it (e.g., using 'let alone'). 5. Continue talking about the main theme in a habit-style, giving opinions using 'I, us, we, people'. Short answers are acceptable for difficult Q15 news questions.
