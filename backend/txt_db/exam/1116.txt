Question 
N/A

Answer 
Honestly, it gets too cold in the winter in Korea so we prefer to go when it's warmer in May or June.

Feedback 
Use 'Honestly' as a connector. You can adapt this sentence for summer ('too hot') and prefer going when it's 'cooler' (e.g., October or November). This sentence can also be used for the 'Seasons' topic. Add emotion to 'too cold/hot'.
