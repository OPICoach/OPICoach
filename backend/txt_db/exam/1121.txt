N/A

Answer 
Oh, and when it gets dark, it's always fun to build a campfire and tell our stories around it.

Feedback 
Use 'Oh, and when it gets dark' as a connector. The structure 'it's always fun to + verb and verb' is useful. You can add activities like 'grill marshmallows' or 'eat grilled marshmallows (smores)'.
