Question 
N/A

Answer 
I highly recommend camping at the beach for those who like spending time outdoors.

Feedback 
Use the correct structure 'I highly recommend + ing'. Avoid 'recommend you to'. 'for those who like spending time outdoors' is a good phrase to add detail. You can recommend visiting a specific place instead of camping.
