Answer 
Okay, well I feel like I need a second to think about it. Uh I need a second to think about it. I feel like Honestly, I don't really like making changes to my home. I guess I'm kind of lazy. Uh besides, I'm quite busy with work, so I don't have much time to stay at home. Anyway, let me think about a change I made. a change I made. To begin with, I'd like to briefly tell you about my home first. I live in a small apartment. And actually it's a studio apartment so there's no separate bedroom. Basically, everything is combined into a single room, which means there is not much space. Also, I try to live a minimalist life so I keep only the things I need. Well, now I can think of one change I made to my place. Recently about two months ago. I bought a new coffee table. I'd already had a table, but I didn't like its color. And honestly, it was too old. So I decided to purchase a new table from IKEA and put it by the window. It's a small table where I can drink coffee and enjoy the sun. um Anyway, I love my place. Although it is such a small apartment, I've got everything I need.

Feedback 
The question asks about changes made to your home, the specific changes, satisfaction with them, and details. This is a typical combo question from the 'Living Place - Home' background survey topic. These topics account for about 50% of the test questions and require detailed, longer answers for higher scores. The answer structure provided includes an introduction (thinking time, reluctance to change), a description of the home (small apartment, studio, minimalist concept), the specific change (buying a coffee table), and a conclusion (satisfaction with the home). Key strategies suggested are: choosing a small house concept (easier to describe and manage items), focusing on just one change but providing details, and adopting a minimalist lifestyle concept to justify having few items. Important elements highlighted for OPIc include: using filler words and connectors (well, you know, honestly, I guess, besides, anyway, to begin with, which means, also, um) to sound natural and fill pauses; practicing past tense for experience questions (bought, had, didn't like, was, decided to purchase, put); using phrases like 'I need a second to think about it', 'I feel like', 'I guess I'm kind of lazy', 'busy with work', 'let me think about', 'think of', 'which means', 'I try to live a minimalist life', 'keep only the things I need', 'I'd already had', 'decided to purchase/buy/get', 'put it by the window', 'where I can drink coffee and enjoy the sun', 'Although it is such a small apartment', 'I've got everything I need', 'satisfied with the changes/table'. Pronunciation tips were given for 'kind of' (kind of), 'separate' (separate), 'minimalist', 'I'd', 'purchase', 'IKEA/IKEA', and 'I've got'. Grammatical points included the use of 'had had' (contracted as 'I'd had') for past perfect, 'which means' for adding explanatory clauses, and noting that 'although' should not be followed by 'but'. The feedback also suggests rephrasing the question back ('changes I made to my home?') as a way to start and emphasizes the importance of repeated practice (saying aloud, recording, mirror practice) for fluency and natural delivery, avoiding sounding overly memorized. Adding satisfaction with the change/table in the conclusion is also suggested based on the question.
