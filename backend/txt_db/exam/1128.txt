Question 
Describe the beach you like to visit. Where is it located and what does it look like? Why do you like it?

Answer 
This is a good question because there are many beautiful beaches I like to go with my family. I really like going to the beach because I love spending time in nature. There are lots of beautiful beaches in Korea and my family loves to take a trip to the beach. I guess we typically go a couple of times a year in the spring. Honestly, it gets too cold in the winter in Korea. So we prefer to go when it's warmer in May or June. Our typical routine at the beach includes relaxing and chilling on the sand. During the day we love to swim in the ocean. In addition, we always watch the sunset and take a lot of pictures and videos. You know what? Having the barbecue, watching the sunset is always an incredible experience. Oh and when it gets dark, it's always fun to build a campfire or make a campfire and tell our stories around it. So anyway, I would say beach camping is always an amazing experience. I highly recommend camping at the beach for those who like spending time outdoors.

Feedback 
This script is suitable for IH to AL levels. Key feedback points include: 1. Natural delivery, intonation, and stress are crucial; avoid sounding memorized or like an AI. 2. Use fillers (e.g., 'I guess', 'Honestly', 'You know what', 'So anyway') for natural flow. 3. Provide details and explanations (TMI is okay, like explaining why you go in spring). 4. Vary sentence structures (e.g., using gerunds as subjects like 'Having the barbecue...', time clauses like 'when it gets dark'). 5. Vary subject beginnings (not just 'I' or 'We', but 'Our typical routine...', 'Having the barbecue...'). 6. Focus on learning key verb phrases/ideas first (e.g., 'swim in the ocean', 'watch the sunset', 'build a campfire') before memorizing full sentences. 7. Brainstorming in Korean helps organize ideas and ensure you have content. 8. Practice speaking aloud frequently is essential. 9. Connecting related topics (beach, camping, travel, geography, park) makes preparation efficient. 10. The suggested structure is Introduction (liking the topic), Body 1 (frequency, time, companions), Body 2 (activities - most important part, describe richly), Conclusion (recommendation).
