Question 
You indicate in the survey that you volunteer. When and where do you volunteer? What kind of activities do you do when you volunteer? Why do you do that?

Answer 
Examples illustrating different levels:
IM: I do volunteer work at my friend's church to make lunch for homeless people. Whenever I go there, I do the dishes. In the past, it was different.
IH: I do some volunteer work at my friend's church by making lunch for homeless people. Whenever I go there, I'm often doing a lot of dishes. When it comes to volunteering, in the past it was different.
AL: I actually involve myself to some volunteer work every Sunday at a friend's church by providing lunch to the homeless. And so whenever I'm there, I often find myself at the kitchen doing a lot of dishes. Now, if I may be honest, when it comes to volunteering, it wasn't the same. (or I wasn't always like this.)

Feedback 
The instructor compares answers across IM, IH, and AL levels using the volunteering question.

IM answers are simple and direct. They may lack specific details, frequency words, and varied sentence structures. Examples use 'to make' instead of 'by making' and simple structures like 'I do the dishes'. 'In the past' is used simply at the beginning of a sentence.

IH answers show improvement by adding qualifiers like 'some', using '-ing' forms ('by making', 'doing'), incorporating frequency adverbs ('often'), using patterns like 'a lot of', and using phrases like 'When it comes to...' at the beginning of a clause.

AL answers demonstrate sophisticated vocabulary ('involve myself', 'providing', 'to the homeless'), smooth use of adverbs ('actually'), advanced patterns ('find myself doing'), inclusion of extra details ('at the kitchen'), effective transitions ('And so'), and complex sentence starters ('If I may be honest'). AL speakers can also structure sentences starting with a negative and ending with a positive ('it wasn't the same', 'I wasn't always like this'), which is a more advanced skill than starting positive and ending negative. They also use articles like 'a' ('at a friend's church') more naturally when referring to something unknown to the listener.
