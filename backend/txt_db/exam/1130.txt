Question 
Do you think our answer sheet is evaluated by only one rater or various others more than two?

Answer 
A single rater listens to questions 1 through 15. Then another rater listens to all of them. If the scores match, that's the score. If they don't match, a third rater is involved, and the score is averaged.

Feedback 
This is my understanding, but I could be wrong. Essentially, two raters listen to your entire test, and possibly a third if their scores differ.
