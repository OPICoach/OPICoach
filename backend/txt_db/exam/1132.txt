Question 
I need IM3. What level of difficulty should I do?

Answer 
Choose difficulty level 6-6.

Feedback 
Always choose the highest difficulty level (6-6). The higher the difficulty, the higher the potential score you can receive. Even fluent speakers cannot get AL if they choose a low difficulty level. Don't choose based on your perceived current skill, choose based on the score you want.
