Question 
Can I sing when I introduce myself?

Answer 
Yes, you can sing.

Feedback 
Singing is fine, especially if it's short and adds a fun element. For example, sing a short line from a song you like. However, don't sing for too long (like 4 minutes), as you will get a zero score. Have '눈치' (sense/awareness).
