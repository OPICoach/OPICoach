Answer 
Not provided in the text.

Feedback 
This is the first question in a 3-question roleplay set (11, 12, 13). The situation in Q11 often sets up a problem or unavoidable situation for Q12. Since Q11 is asking questions about an interview, anticipate that Q12 will likely involve a situation where you need to cancel or be late for the interview.
