Feedback 
Understanding the questions doesn't take a lot of time. Listen to or watch many mock tests available on platforms like YouTube, Naver, or Google to become familiar with the question types and phrasing. The questions for difficulty 4-4 and 6-6 are quite similar, so choosing 6-6 is still better.
