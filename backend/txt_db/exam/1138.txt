Question 
몰라서 스킵할 때 그냥 넘어가도 정말 상관없나요? 이럴 때 뭐라고 해야?

Answer 
Yes, if you don't know, just skip. Don't say anything.

When you hear a question you don't understand, just wait silently. After about 5 seconds, the 'next question' button will appear. Press it. Do not say anything like 'I don't know' or 'Skip'. Saying something might sound like a script.
