Question 
Is it okay to say 비속어 like 욕 or 욕 F bomb or the shit word?

Answer 
Yes, if you can do it confidently and smoothly, and it comes out naturally in your speech.

Feedback 
It's okay to use such words, especially if done in a joking manner or directed at yourself. Be cautious when using them about other people. The key is confidence and naturalness. This is one reason I like OPIc - you have that freedom if you can handle it.
