Question 
Sam, I know OPIc test is kind of an interview but if I say like talking with real person in test is it more competitive strategy right? And can I say like shit when I get a harsh question?

Answer 
Yes and yes.

Feedback 
While OPIc has an interview component, it's better to approach it like talking to someone on a blind date â€“ friendly but not stiff like a formal interview. And yes, you can say 'shit' if you do it confidently, especially in reaction to a difficult situation or question.
