Question 
8 month for studying OPIc or just using English would be enough at same period.

Answer 
OPIc study should include English conversation practice.

Feedback 
You shouldn't just study OPIc strategy for 8 months. Your OPIc study should incorporate improving your overall English conversation skills. If you only focus on strategy, your English won't improve much. OPIc is English conversation, and English conversation is OPIc. They are one and the same.
