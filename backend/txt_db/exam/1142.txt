Question 
I usually speak slowly but will it sound boring to the score?

Answer 
No, absolutely not.

Feedback 
It's a misunderstanding that speaking slowly prevents a high score. Speaking speed is a personal preference and style. Just speak at your natural flow and speed. Don't try to force yourself to speak faster if it's not natural for you.
