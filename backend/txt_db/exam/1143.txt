Question 
Sam, 4 6 7 9 10 and 13 are past experiences. Can I repeat the same information?

Answer 
Not all those questions are necessarily about past experiences. No, you cannot repeat the same information repeatedly.

Feedback 
Repeating the same information throughout your answers will make it sound heavily scripted, which will result in a very low score. Avoid repeating the same content.
