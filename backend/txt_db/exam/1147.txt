Question 
Is pronunciation important for a high level? Okay. Am I correct grammar?

Answer 
Pronunciation is somewhat important, but not extremely. (Implicitly corrects grammar)

Feedback 
Pronunciation is important to some extent, but not as much as you might think. I've met people with much worse pronunciation than mine (and I'm a 교포) who speak English better than me. Intonation, flow, and natural rhythm ('억양', 'intonation', 'the flow') are much more important than perfect pronunciation. Your grammar in the question ('Am I correct grammar?') is incorrect.
