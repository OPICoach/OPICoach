Question 
Sam, I just finished Pagoda OPIc No Jam and I got IM1 in the beginning of July and I'm gonna take an exam in the beginning of August. I want to get IM3. So is there any advice about studying?

Answer 
Did you practice recording yourself a lot? Did you practice conversing with a partner, coaching each other?

Feedback 
The most helpful method is recording yourself, listening, transcribing (딕테이션), listening again, adjusting, and recording again. Also, practicing conversation with a partner, coaching each other, is crucial. It's hard to improve significantly without practicing speaking and getting feedback. Language is conversation, so practice through conversation.
