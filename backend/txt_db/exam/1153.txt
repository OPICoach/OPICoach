Question 
Whenever I speak English, I feel burdened. Sometimes I can't think of easy words in English but can read, listen and write well. What's my problem?

Answer 
You probably haven't practiced conversation enough.

Feedback 
You need to practice speaking and conversing a lot. Practice by recording yourself or by practicing 1-on-1 with someone. It doesn't have to be a native speaker or a teacher; practicing with any student can be very helpful.
