Question 
What do you like to do at the park? Tell me about your typical day at the park from beginning to end.

Answer 
Okay, it's a good question because I love going to the park. Actually, I go to the park almost every day. Well, maybe four to five times a week these days. Yeah, going to the park is one of my favorite things to do in my free time. So, let me tell you about what I like to do at the park. Basically, I like to work out at the park. You know, working out and getting fresh air at the same time makes me feel so refreshed and healthy. Personally, I like to work out at the park in the morning. Yeah, I definitely enjoy morning workout, especially jogging and stretching. Sometimes I just walk along the trail for like an hour, which is a perfect way to refresh myself. Oh, you know what? I should also mention a spring outing. When it gets warm in the spring in Korea, a lot of flowers in the park begin to blossom. So in April and May, I definitely go for a picnic and hang out under the cherry blossom trees. It's really fun to just chill and relax in the park. Speaking of which, I can't wait for the spring. Maybe I should call some of my friends and go to the park this weekend.

Feedback 
This answer addresses the routine question about activities at the park. The introduction starts with a positive reaction and mentions frequency. Using 'going to the park' as a subject is a good grammatical variation. The body covers two main activities: working out (mentioning benefits like feeling refreshed and healthy, preferred time like morning, specific activities like jogging/stretching, and walking along the trail with fillers like 'basically', 'you know', 'personally', 'sometimes', 'for like an hour', and connecting sentences like 'which is...') and spring outings (using 'oh, you know what?' for topic change, mentioning flowers blooming with 'blossom' or 'bloom', specific months, activities like picnic and hanging out, and describing the feeling with 'chill and relax'). The conclusion uses 'speaking of which' to transition and expresses anticipation ('I can't wait') and a future plan, providing a natural ending. The structure (Intro-Body-Conclusion) and use of fillers and descriptive language help make the answer sound natural and detailed, which is good for higher OPIc levels.
