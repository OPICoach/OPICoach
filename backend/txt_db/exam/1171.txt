Question 
What kind of healthy foods do you enjoy eating? Do you usually prepare healthy meals by yourself or do you get some help from friends, family or acquaintances to eat healthy? Please describe the healthy foods that you enjoy.

Answer 
I don't think I have much to tell you about your question because um I don't think I pay enough attention to my health. I think it's probably because I'm in my 20s and haven't experienced any major health issues. I know I should eat healthier, but you know, I can't give up on junk food like fries, you know, burgers and street food. So, um I'd have to say that um I don't prepare healthy meals for my health.

This answer takes the approach of saying you don't focus on health. Key phrases and points: 'I don't think I pay enough attention to my health' is better than 'I don't care about my health' (IM level vs. IH/AL). 'pay attention' is a good alternative to 'care about'. 'enough' adds sophistication. 'I think it's probably because...' is a very useful pattern for explaining reasons, applicable to many topics. 'eat healthier' correctly uses the comparative form (avoid 'eat more healthy'). 'give up on something' is an important phrase for conversation ('Don't give up on me', 'give up on your passion'). 'I'd have to say that...' is a good phrase for stating a conclusion or opinion, useful across topics. This approach shows you can still provide a coherent answer even if the topic isn't your focus, using useful general expressions.
