Question 
Let's start the interview now. Please tell me a little bit about yourself.

Answer 
Hi Eva, I'm [Your Name]. I was born and raised in [City], which is a really beautiful coastal city in Korea. Back in the days when I was a teenager, I spent a lot of time swimming and surfing. I'm currently studying engineering in college and I'm going to graduate this year, so I've been looking for a job. In my free time, I like listening to music, playing games, and working out. Also, I'm a huge fan of baseball, so I sometimes invite my friends to watch a baseball game together. As for my personality, I'm really outgoing and a little bit laid back. It seems like I don't have worries.

Feedback 
Self-introduction is not graded but is important for confidence. Avoid sounding memorized. Use descriptive adjectives (e.g., 'really beautiful coastal city'). Add personal stories or details related to places or hobbies. Use varied verb tenses (past, present, present perfect) for higher levels (IH/AL). Use diverse vocabulary (e.g., 'working out' instead of 'exercise', 'I'm a huge fan of' instead of 'I like/love'). Use Y-ending adjectives (e.g., 'outdoorsy') for higher scores. Connect sentences using conjunctions or phrases like 'so', 'also', 'as for', 'when it comes to' to form paragraphs (crucial for IH). Use natural fillers ('um', 'you know', 'well', 'like', 'I mean') to sound spontaneous. Avoid starting sentences with 'About...' when describing personality. Use versatile phrases like 'a great stress reliever'.
