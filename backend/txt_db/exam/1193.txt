Question 
You may go to a hair salon or barber shop. Please tell me about the hair salon or barber shop you often visit. What does it look like? Where is it located? What is special about it? Describe the hair salon or barber shop in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
This question asks about a hair salon or barber shop you often visit. A good answer should follow the MBC (Main Idea, Body, Conclusion) structure. Start by expressing slight surprise or thoughtfulness about the question (e.g., 'Wow, a hair salon, I've never really thought about this'). Introduce the name of your go-to salon (e.g., 'My go-to hair salon is named Hackers', perhaps adding a joke like 'don't get me wrong, it's not literally for hackers, just kidding'). In the body, describe its location (e.g., 'It's located within walking distance of my home', 'It's just a five minute walk away', 'it takes about five minutes'). Explain why you go there often, emphasizing the location ('That's the biggest reason why I often visit there'). Add something special about it, like the price (e.g., 'You know what I love the most? The price is super reasonable', 'It's less than $10 for a haircut', 'it's so affordable, right?'). You can use phrases like 'as far as I remember' for details. Conclude by suggesting an action related to the topic (e.g., 'Eva, do you have any plans this weekend? Why don't we go get a haircut together?'). Remember to use conversational fillers and maintain a natural flow.

Feedback 
The lecture provides several techniques to make your OPIc answer more engaging and natural. Key techniques include: 1. Know your audience: Treat Eva like a friend and use a conversational tone. 2. Clear structure: Use the MBC structure (Main Idea, Body, Conclusion). 3. Engaging content: Use storytelling, hooks (like asking a question at the start), and examples. Avoid boring or obviously memorized stories. 4. Vocal variety: Vary your tone, volume, and speed to sound natural and express emotion. Speed changes (like a roller coaster) indicate spontaneity. 5. Body language: Even though it's audio, use expressions and gestures while speaking to sound less robotic (practice in front of a mirror or with a friend). 6. Attention-getting techniques: Ask rhetorical questions to Eva (e.g., 'Do you remember?', 'Have you ever?', 'right?') or use commands (e.g., 'Listen!', 'Picture this!', 'Call me'). 7. Humor/Authenticity: Don't be too serious; use humor or slightly exaggerated stories. Use fillers like 'well', 'you know what?'. 8. Confidence/Passion: Speak confidently even if you make mistakes. Show enthusiasm. 9. Practice/Rehearse: Record yourself and listen back to check for naturalness and flow. 10. Anxiety control: Use deep breathing and focus on the message you want to convey rather than the test situation. Specific phrases introduced include: 'don't get me wrong' (to clarify), 'It's located within walking distance of my home' (location), 'It's a five minute walk away' (distance), 'That's the biggest reason why' (explaining cause), 'You know what I love the most?' (introducing a favorite point), 'as far as I remember' (introducing memory), 'reasonable'/'affordable' (price), 'Why don't we...?' (suggestion), 'go get a haircut' (getting a haircut done by someone else).
