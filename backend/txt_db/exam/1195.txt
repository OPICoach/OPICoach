Your sentences are all grammatically correct and easy to understand. You correctly use simple present and past tenses. The vocabulary is appropriate for the topics mentioned. However, for an OPIc response, these are mostly short, simple sentences that are not connected. To improve your score, try to connect your ideas using linking words (like 'and', 'but', 'so', 'because') and add more detail or explanation to each point. For example, instead of just 'I watch comedies,' you could say 'I watch comedies because they help me relax after a long day, and my favorite is...' Also, ensure your entire response is in English; the phrase '점수 잡는 해커스' is not an English sentence and should not be included in your OPIc answer.
