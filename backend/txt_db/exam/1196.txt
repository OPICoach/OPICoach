Question 
How is the way people bought food changed over the years? Where did people use to purchase food in the past and where do they purchase it now? Describe in details.

Answer 
Wow. This is a really difficult question. I mean, I haven't thought about it. Well, this is something I've never thought about and you know, I haven't watched any news related to this topic and I hardly watched the news these days. So, hmm, I'm not sure what to say about the past. But I know that many people buy food online nowadays. Yeah, I mean these days people do literally everything on the internet. Not to mention grocery shopping. Speaking of purchasing food, although there are many nice grocery stores, a lot of people prefer to buy things online. And I think this is because it's a lot easier and faster. You just need to click the few buttons on your phone or computer and the next morning you'll get your groceries delivered. Isn't it amazing? I guess that's all I can say about this topic. And I'm gonna have to say things have become more convenient nowadays thanks to the internet. Well, that's pretty much it.

Feedback 
This is a high-difficulty question asking for a comparison between past and present food purchasing methods. The suggested answer uses '위기 탈출 대사' (crisis escape phrases) effectively in the introduction to acknowledge the difficulty and lack of prior thought on the topic. It's a good strategy to admit uncertainty about the past ('I'm not sure what to say about the past') and then focus heavily on the present situation, which is easier to describe. Key phrases and vocabulary used in the suggested answer are: fillers (Wow, I mean, Well, you know, Hmm, Yeah), stating difficulty ('This is a really difficult question'), admitting lack of knowledge/thought ('I haven't thought about it', 'This is something I've never thought about', 'I haven't watched any news related to this topic', 'I hardly watched the news these days'), transitioning ('But I know that'), describing present trends ('buy food online nowadays', 'do literally everything on the internet', 'Not to mention grocery shopping', 'prefer to buy things online'), explaining reasons ('because it's a lot easier and faster'), describing the process ('click the few buttons', 'get your groceries delivered'), using rhetorical questions ('Isn't it amazing?'), and concluding clearly ('That's all I can say about this topic', 'things have become more convenient', 'thanks to the internet', 'That's pretty much it'). The use of 'literally' and 'a lot' adds natural emphasis. The feedback emphasizes that focusing on the present is acceptable if the past is unknown and that maintaining flow and natural tone is crucial for a good score, even with minor grammatical errors.
