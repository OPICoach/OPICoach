Question 
I'd like to know about the most popular technologies in your country. Why do people prefer to use them? What are they used for? Please tell me in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
Well, um the most popular technology people use in my country is, you know, um, smartphones. I once read an article that said, you know, around like um 90% of the population in my country use smartphones. Smartphones are not just phones, you know, they're like portable computer devices. We can do so many things with our smartphones. I think the most useful function that smartphones have is, you know, um internet access. Um free Wi-Fi is everywhere in Korea, which means you can surf the internet almost like everywhere. In addition, a lot of people use social media um on their smartphones. So, um I think the reason for this is that they can easily post pictures taken on their cell phones on Instagram or on Facebook. on on Instagram or Facebook.

Feedback 
Start simply, use fillers (um, you know, well), vary speed/intonation/stress. Avoid sounding memorized. Use specific vocabulary (smartphones, article, population, portable computer device, internet access, surf the internet, free Wi-Fi, everywhere, social media vs SNS, on social, on Instagram/Facebook/YouTube/cell phone, be into, a big fan of). 'Everywhere' is a useful expression for saying something is common or numerous (e.g., Cafes are everywhere, Subway stations are everywhere). Use 'on' with websites/media/devices (on the website, on Instagram, on my cell phone, on Google, on YouTube). Avoid 'by my cell phone'.
