Question 
Talk about the first coffee shop you went to. What was special about that place? What do you remember most?

Answer 
My first coffee shop is Starbucks. Why Starbucks was special to me? Because the coffee was so delicious. especially their Frappuccino.

Feedback 
Change 'is' to 'was' for past experience. Instead of 'Why Starbucks was special to me?', start with a pronoun like 'It was special because...'. For 'Because the coffee was so delicious', using 'Their coffee' is more skillful (Their refers to the store/people). 'especially their Frappuccino' is good. Use the root word strategy: if you used 'amazing' for the main point, use 'amazed' in the body (e.g., 'I was truly amazed by their coffee'). Practice pronouns like it, them, they, their.
