Feedback 
You are a very good speaker with a fast pace, which can be a strength. Control your pace: slow down for feelings/emphasis, speed up for facts to improve intonation. Your main point ("I have a favorite cafe nearby my home") is weak; it needs the 'why' (the reason it's your favorite). Add 'because' to explain the reason clearly (e.g., friend works there, free drinks). For this question, focus on describing the cafe's environment (not crowded, quiet, etc.) rather than lengthy details about your habits (studying, frequency of visits), which are better suited for a habit question. Specific corrections: 'by my foot' should be 'on foot' or 'to get there'. 'by walk' is also awkward. 'I always studying' should be 'I always study'. 'the most cleanest' should be 'the cleanest'. 'I having like fresh coffee' should be 'I'm having fresh coffee' or 'I have fresh coffee'.
