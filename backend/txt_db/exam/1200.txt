Question 
Where was the last place you traveled to? How was the trip?

Answer 
Last month, I spent three days in Kangnung. There was a special deal on tours to Kangnung for the weekend. Before that, I had never been there. My friends and I went for the long weekend. We did the tours in the mornings and went to the beach in the afternoons. Each evening, we had a real nice dinner somewhere overlooking the sea. It was a great three days. I like going to the beach, but not for too long.

This answer is good for topics like beach trips, domestic travel, and international travel by changing the location. The question is a common second question in a combo, asking about a recent experience (past tense). For 'Last month, I spent three days in Kangnung', you can change 'Kangnung' to fit the topic. Note the pronunciation of 'spent three days' where the 't' sound is often soft or omitted. 'There was a special deal on tours to Kangnung' means there was a special discount trip. 'Before that, I had never been there' uses the past perfect ('had never been there'), which is an advanced tense useful for IH/AL scores, indicating you hadn't been there *before* that past trip. Remember 'My friends and I' is the correct order. 'Went for the long weekend' means a long weekend trip. 'We did the tours in the mornings' means we went sightseeing; 'in the mornings' (with 's') indicates this happened every morning. Similarly, 'in the afternoons' means every afternoon. 'Somewhere overlooking the sea' means a place with a view of the sea; you could also say 'at a restaurant with a nice view of the ocean'. 'It was a great three days' might sound unusual but is a natural native expression treating the duration as a single unit, like 'a very good couple of days', and sounds fluent. To make the beach description richer for higher scores, you can add phrases like 'a lovely stroll on the beach', 'the sun shining', 'the waves lapping', and 'the sea breeze blowing'.
