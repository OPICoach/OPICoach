Question 
Tell me about the clothing you wear when you do yoga. What do you usually wear when you practice yoga? Describe everything in details.

Answer 
Okay, the clothing I wear when I do yoga. This is an interesting question, but honestly, I haven't really thought about it. I mean, I'm not so interested in fashion and clothing. Yeah, so I can say I don't really care about what I wear, especially when I work out. I guess I just wear something comfortable like t-shirts, sweatpants, or spandex leggings. Those are really comfortable. In addition, I wear grip socks because you know, they prevent sleeping. I think those socks are really important when you do yoga because your feet might get sweaty. Yep, so I make sure to wear those socks and keep myself steady. That's pretty much it, I think. Oh, one more thing. Sometimes I'd like to practice yoga outside in the park. So when I do yoga outdoors, I make sure to wear sunscreen and sunglasses.

Feedback 
The answer is well-structured and directly addresses the question. The speaker uses natural language and provides specific examples of clothing (t-shirts, sweatpants, spandex leggings, grip socks). The explanation for wearing grip socks is clear, although 'prevent sleeping' should be 'prevent slipping'. Adding the detail about practicing outdoors and wearing sunscreen/sunglasses shows initiative and provides extra information, which is good for OPIc. Overall, a solid answer with good detail and flow.
