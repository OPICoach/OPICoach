Question 
How did you first become interested in practicing yoga? When did you start? Has your physical condition changed since you started doing yoga?

Answer 
Well, I first became interested in stretching and doing yoga when I was in college. Yeah, that was when I was about 20 years old. Back then, I was out of shape and my posture wasn't really good either. So, I decided to lose some weight and get back in shape. That was how I decided to learn yoga. I found a good yoga studio near my home and started taking a class there. You know, I was a beginner back then, so I needed a teacher. Now, I don't go to a yoga studio anymore, but I regularly stretch and practice some yoga poses at home. I guess I've been working out and doing yoga for about five years. I feel like yoga has definitely improved my flexibility, strength, and posture. Oh, and I've lost some weight too. Maybe about 3 kilos since the first time I did yoga.

Feedback 
This answer effectively addresses all parts of the question. The speaker clearly states when they started (college, around 20), explains the reason for starting (out of shape, bad posture, wanting to lose weight), describes how they started (finding a studio, taking classes), mentions their current practice (at home), gives a timeframe (about five years), and details the physical changes (improved flexibility, strength, posture, lost weight). The language is natural and easy to follow. Good use of phrases like 'out of shape' and 'get back in shape'.
