Question 
Have you ever had an interesting or special experience while doing yoga? When and where was it? What happened? Talk about the incident in details.

Answer 
Okay, I guess I can tell you about an interesting experience I had a few years ago. It was when I took this very special yoga class at the park. One day, I was running at the park in my town. It was a beautiful day in the spring, so the park was full of people running, walking, and riding a bike. And while I was running there, I saw a group of people doing yoga.

Feedback 
The answer starts well by setting the scene (when and where - a few years ago, at the park) and describing the initial situation (running, seeing a group). The narrative builds nicely, explaining the speaker's curiosity and interaction with the group. Phrases like 'kind of special', 'got kind of curious', and 'all of a sudden' add naturalness. However, the answer is incomplete, cutting off just as the interaction is about to be described in detail. To fully answer the prompt, the speaker would need to continue and explain what happened after being invited to join.
