Question 
Please describe a place you often go to, like your office or a park you like, and tell me what you usually do or see there.

Answer 
There is a photocopier in my office. There are many benches in the park. There is a library on the campus. There are many apartment buildings in my neighborhood. There are many trees and flowers in the park. There are a lot of tourist attractions. It is fun to play soccer with them. It is important to exercise every day. My office is quiet, so it is easy to rest during my lunch break. It is my job to conduct orientation seminars for new employees.

Feedback 
Your answer uses 'There is/are' and 'It is' structures correctly, which is good for describing things and making general statements. You also use basic vocabulary related to places and activities. However, the answer feels like a collection of separate sentences rather than a connected response to a single question. For example, mentioning 'tourist attractions' or 'playing soccer with them' doesn't clearly relate to the descriptions of your office, park, or neighborhood. To improve, try to connect your sentences more smoothly using transition words and focus your answer more directly on the question asked, perhaps describing one place in more detail or linking the different places/activities together logically.
