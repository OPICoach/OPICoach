Question 
Please tell me about your most memorable experience that you had when you used social media. What happened? Why was it so memorable to you?

Answer 
Sample answer based on YouTube (ChatGPT generated, discussed for content and phrases):
My most memorable experience with YouTube happened a couple of years ago. I was trying to fix my washing machine because it suddenly stopped working and I had no idea what to do. Instead of calling a repair man right away I decided to search for a solution on YouTube. To my surprise I found a detailed tutorial from someone who explained exactly what was wrong with my model. They showed step by step instructions and I followed along while pausing the video to make sure I got it right. After about an hour of work I managed to fix the machine completely on my own. This experience was so memorable because it made me realize just how useful YouTube can be for solving real life problems. It wasn't just for entertainment. It saved me time and money and gave me a sense of accomplishment. I'll never forget how empowering that felt.
