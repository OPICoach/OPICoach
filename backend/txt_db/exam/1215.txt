Question 
What types of music did you like when you were young? How was the taste different from the music you listen to today? How has your taste in music changed since your childhood? Please tell me everything.

Answer 
Oh wow. This is a very tricky question because I haven't thought about it at all. I mean I started listening to music a long time ago. Well now that I think about it I guess my musical tastes have definitely changed. When I was a teenager I think I really enjoyed listening to pop music. Some of my favorite singers were Beyonce and Rihanna. I used to listen to a lot of their upbeat songs with catchy rhythm and beats. Such pop songs would help me stay focused and cheerful. As I get older though I don't think I like only one particular kind of music. I'd have to say that I have diverse musical tastes which means I'm not so picky about music. So I enjoy listening to various types of music including jazz, electronic, classical music, etc. I feel like I'll always be a music buff. So anyway I appreciate all genres of music. Music has the power to make us feel good so music is a great healer for our hearts and souls. I can't imagine my life without music.

This AL level answer effectively addresses the question about changing music tastes from past to present. The introduction handles the difficulty of the question using 'tricky question', 'haven't thought about it at all', and natural fillers like 'Oh wow', 'I mean', 'Well'. It uses 'Now that I think about it' and 'my musical tastes have definitely changed' to state the main point. Body 1 discusses past preferences (teenager) using past tense verbs ('was', 'enjoyed', 'were', 'used to', 'would help'). It provides specific details (pop music, singers, upbeat songs) and adds descriptive vocabulary ('catchy rhythm and beats'). It uses 'would' for past habits. Body 2 discusses present preferences and the change, using 'As I get older though' for transition. It uses present tense and varied vocabulary ('particular kind', 'diverse musical tastes', 'not so picky', 'various types', 'etc.'). It connects ideas smoothly using 'which means'. It includes an AL expression 'music buff' and a statement about the future ('I'll always be'). The conclusion summarizes the appreciation for all genres ('appreciate all genres') using 'genre' pronunciation. It includes general statements about music's power using AL expressions like 'great healer for our hearts and souls' and a strong concluding sentence 'I can't imagine my life without music'. The answer demonstrates strong command of tenses, varied vocabulary, complex sentence structures, and natural flow with fillers and transitions, characteristic of AL.
