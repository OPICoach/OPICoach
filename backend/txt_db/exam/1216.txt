Question 
You indicated in the survey that you prefer to stay at home during your vacations. How do you spend your vacation at home? What do you usually do? Give me all the details.

Answer 
Okay. Well, I love to stay home during vacations because I'm such a home body. Actually, I generally prefer to stay home and rest on weekends too. So, let me tell you about what I do when I spend my vacation alone at home. Basically, I get kind of lazy and I don't feel like doing anything when I'm home for vacations. This is because I'm typically busy with work and studies, so I feel pretty tired by the time my vacation starts. So, what I like to do during vacations includes listening to music and watching some good movies in bed or on the couch. Listening to my favorite music lying in bed is my favorite thing to do. Sometimes, I like to invite my friends or family for dinner. When we get together in my place, we usually eat a lot and talk. I normally get some food delivered for them or cook a special meal. Honestly though, I'm not a good cook, but cooking for my beloved family and friends makes me happy. Overall, for me, spending my vacations at home is a great way to relieve stress.

Feedback 
The answer starts well by confirming the survey response and using the idiomatic expression 'home body'. The structure is clear, moving from general preference to specific activities like listening to music, watching movies, and inviting friends/family. Phrases like 'get kind of lazy', 'don't feel like doing anything', 'typically busy', and 'get some food delivered' are natural and conversational. The inclusion of personal details like not being a good cook but enjoying cooking for loved ones adds authenticity. The concluding sentence effectively summarizes the benefit of staying home.
