Question 
Tell me about a memorable vacation you had at home. When was it and who were you with? What did you do? What made the vacation so special? Describe what you did in detail.

Answer 
A memorable vacation I spent at home? Well, I've spent a lot of my vacations at home, so it's kind of hard for me to choose one special event. Well, I guess I can tell you about a time when I spent Christmas with my best friend Jenny. It was two years ago on Christmas Eve. I invited my best friend Jenny to my home because we both had nothing to do on Christmas Eve. Yeah, we both didn't have a boyfriend back then. Haha. So, we decided to celebrate Christmas together in my apartment. So I cooked pasta and prepared some wine and champagne and Jenny baked really good Christmas cookies and cakes. Guess what? Everything was perfect. The food, the music, Christmas carols and everything was so nice. So we ate, drank, and talked all night. It was so much fun to hang out with her because, you know, it was Merry Christmas. Now that I think about it, we didn't really do anything special, but I feel it was special because it was with my best friend.

Feedback 
The response directly addresses the prompt by repeating the question and acknowledging the difficulty in choosing one memory. It provides specific details: the event (Christmas Eve), the time (two years ago), and the person (best friend Jenny). The reason for the gathering ('had nothing to do', 'didn't have a boyfriend') adds a personal and relatable touch. Specific activities like cooking pasta, preparing drinks, and baking cookies are mentioned. Conversational phrases like 'Guess what?' and 'you know' are used naturally. The conclusion effectively explains *why* the event was memorable despite the activities not being inherently unique, focusing on the company.
