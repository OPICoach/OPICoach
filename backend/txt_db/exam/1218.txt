Question 
When was the last time you spent your vacation at home? What did you do? Tell me everything you did in detail.

Answer 
Okay, I guess I can tell you about my very recent vacation at home, which was last week. I stayed home for three days because I had a very bad cold. I got three days off from work because I was feeling terrible, especially my throat. Yeah, I had a really bad sore throat and a headache. So I wanted to rest and fully recover from it. So, what I did at home was just eat and sleep. Oh, and I watched a lot of movies in bed too. I'm a big fan of Marvel series, so it was a good chance for me to watch my favorite Marvel movies again. And you know what? I was feeling so ill that I wasn't able to cook. I didn't feel like cooking. So for every meal, I had my favorite food delivered to my home. I ate really good sushi, pizza, Korean barbecue, etc. I feel like I've gained a few pounds, but I guess that's fine because I'm feeling a lot better this week.

Feedback 
The answer provides a clear timeframe ('last week') and duration ('three days'). It gives a specific reason for staying home (a bad cold) and details the symptoms ('terrible', 'sore throat', 'headache'). The main activities ('eat and sleep', 'watched a lot of movies') are simple but directly answer the question. Adding the detail about being a Marvel fan makes the answer more personal. The explanation for ordering food delivery ('feeling so ill', 'didn't feel like cooking') is natural. Listing specific food items ('sushi, pizza, Korean barbecue') adds detail. The concluding sentence about gaining weight but feeling better provides a nice wrap-up.
