Question 
Tell me about recycling in your country. What kind of items do people recycle? Describe the recycling system in your country.

Answer 
Oh wow, the recycling system in my country? I have to say this is a very difficult topic. I mean, honestly, I have no idea about the recycling system in my country. This is something I haven't deeply thought about. Well, I mean, basically, recycling is absolutely mandatory in Korea. And I believe it's fairly well practiced everywhere in Korea. I feel like every building in Seoul has recycling facilities and most people are aware that recycling has to be done on a daily basis. Yeah, I guess that's all I can say about this question.

Feedback 
The response effectively handles a difficult topic by being honest about the lack of detailed knowledge ('I have no idea', 'haven't deeply thought about'). It uses hesitation markers ('Oh wow', 'I mean') naturally. Despite the lack of detail, it provides some general facts about recycling in Korea ('absolutely mandatory', 'fairly well practiced', 'every building in Seoul has facilities', 'most people are aware'). The concluding phrase 'I guess that's all I can say' is a good way to signal the end of the response when unsure how to elaborate further.
