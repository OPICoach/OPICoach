Question 
Tell me about how you practice recycling at home. Do you recycle every day? Where do you take out the recycling to? Describe the ways you recycle.

Answer 
Oh, this is another very hard one. So you're asking how I recycle at home? Well, could you give me a second to think about it? Honestly, I don't really do a lot of house chores because I live alone in a small apartment and I'm normally very busy that I don't spend a lot of time at home. So I'm saying I hardly recycle. You know, since I don't really cook or eat at home, there's not a lot of recycling to do. When it comes to how often I recycle, I generally take out the recycling every two weeks. Yeah, not so often. I gather the recyclable items like paper, glass, and plastic in the recycling basket and I take them out when I need to. Well, I guess that's it.

Feedback 
Similar to the previous answer, the response acknowledges the difficulty ('another very hard one'). It uses conversational fillers ('could you give me a second to think about it?', 'You know'). The explanation for limited recycling is clear and logical, linking it to living alone, having a small apartment, being busy, and not cooking/eating at home often. It provides a specific frequency ('every two weeks') and lists common recyclable items ('paper, glass, and plastic'). The description of the process ('gather... in the recycling basket and I take them out') is simple and direct. The conclusion ('Well, I guess that's it') is effective.
