Feedback 
The response directly addresses the prompt by stating the lack of a memorable experience, referencing a previous answer ('as I said earlier').

The description of the event is straightforward ('recycling by my apartment building', 'woman recycling next to me came to me and started talking'). The answer cuts off before the neighbor's speech is included.
