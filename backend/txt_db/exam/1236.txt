Question 
Tell me about a time you helped someone.

Answer 
I saved a child who is drowning.

Feedback 
This sentence uses a relative clause ('who is drowning') correctly to describe the child. 'saved' and 'drowning' are strong verbs. Ensure the context makes this dramatic event believable if used in a real test.
