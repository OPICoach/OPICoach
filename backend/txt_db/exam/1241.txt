Question 
Tell me about the last concert you went to.

Answer 
I went to the concert with my friends, who are fans of J Soul.

Feedback 
This sentence correctly uses a non-restrictive relative clause ('who are fans of J Soul') with a comma to add extra information about the friends. 'fans of' is appropriate vocabulary.
