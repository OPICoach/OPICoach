Question 
What is your favorite facility?

Answer 
My favorite facility is the public library near my home. I like it because it is quiet and has many books. I go there almost every week to read or study. It is a good place to relax.

Feedback 
This is a good, clear answer. You used simple but effective sentences to describe your favorite facility and why you like it. 'near my home' adds helpful detail about the location. 'almost every week' effectively communicates frequency. 'It is a good place to relax' is a nice concluding sentence. The vocabulary used, such as 'public library,' 'quiet,' and 'relax,' is appropriate and easy to understand.
