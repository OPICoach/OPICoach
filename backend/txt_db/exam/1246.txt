Question 
Why did you choose that school?

Answer 
I choose my school because it has good reputation for my major. Also, the location is very convenience for me. Many of my friends also go there, so I can study together with them. The tuition fee was also reasonable.

Feedback 
Good attempt to explain your reasons for choosing the school. Let's look at some specifics:
- Sentence 1: 'I choose my school' should be in the past tense, 'I chose my school.' 'good reputation for my major' is good.
- Sentence 2: 'the location is very convenience' should use the adjective form, 'the location is very convenient.'
- Sentence 3: 'Many of my friends also go there, so I can study together with them' is correct and well-structured.
- Sentence 4: 'The tuition fee was also reasonable' is correct.
- Vocabulary like 'reputation,' 'major,' 'convenient,' 'tuition fee,' and 'reasonable' are good choices. Focus on using the correct verb tense ('chose') and the correct form of words (adjective 'convenient' instead of noun 'convenience').
