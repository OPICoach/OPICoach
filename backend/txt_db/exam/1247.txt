Feedback 
This is a good descriptive answer about your movie-watching habits.
- Sentence 1: 'I watch movies quite often' is correct.
- Sentence 2: 'Maybe two or three times a week' is a fragment, but acceptable in spoken English. You could make it a full sentence like 'I watch them maybe two or three times a week.'
- Sentence 3: 'on streaming service' should ideally have an article or be plural, e.g., 'on a streaming service' or 'on streaming services.'
- Sentence 4: 'on weekend' should be 'on the weekend' or 'on weekends.'
- Sentence 5: 'many kind of movies' should be 'many kinds of movies' (plural 'kinds'). 'like action and comedy' is good for examples.
- Vocabulary like 'quite often,' 'streaming service,' 'cinema,' 'action,' and 'comedy' are appropriate. Pay attention to small grammatical points like articles ('a,' 'the') and plural forms ('kinds,' 'weekends,' 'services').
