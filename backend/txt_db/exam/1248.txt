Feedback 
Your answer covers various aspects of your life, including your school, major, job, personality, hobbies, and a memorable event. This is a good start for an OPIc response.

Here are some specific points for improvement:

1.  **Redundancy:** You mentioned "I am a freshman at Hankuk University" and later "I go to Hankuk University." The second sentence is redundant. You can combine the information about your school's location with the first mention: "I am a freshman at Hankuk University, which is located in Seoul."
2.  **Sentence Variety:** Most of your sentences are simple. To make your answer sound more natural and fluent, try varying your sentence structure. For example, you could combine the sentences about the campus festival: "The most memorable event for me was a campus festival, which was a very interesting day."
3.  **Detail:** While you mentioned the campus festival was interesting, adding a little more specific detail (e.g., what made it interesting? Were there performances, food, activities?) would make your answer more engaging.
4.  **Flow:** The transition between topics is a bit abrupt. Using simple transition words or phrases could help. For instance, after talking about your job and personality, you could say, "In my free time, I enjoy reading books."
5.  **Vocabulary:** The vocabulary is clear and functional. Depending on your target level, you could explore slightly more descriptive adjectives or phrases.

Overall, your answer is easy to understand and addresses the prompt. Focusing on reducing redundancy, varying sentence structure, and adding a little more detail will help improve your score.
