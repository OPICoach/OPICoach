Question 
Could you please tell me a little bit about yourself, maybe about your school life and your work?

Answer 
I am taking a marketing class this semester. The most memorable event in a class was when I got a perfect score on my exam. I am working at an electronics company. It is located in Busan and it was established in 1984. My company is known for its excellent customer service. There are desks and chairs in my office. I am a regular employee in the planning department. My responsibilities include researching industry trends. I worked on a market analysis project. I work overtime because I have many projects these days.

Your answer provides relevant information about your school and work life. The sentences are clear and easy to understand. You use appropriate vocabulary for describing your job and company. To improve, try to connect your ideas more smoothly between sentences and topics. For example, you could use transition words or conjunctions (like 'also', 'in addition', 'however', 'so'). Varying your sentence structure could also make your response more dynamic. For instance, instead of just listing facts, you could combine some short sentences or add more descriptive details. Be careful not to repeat sentences during the actual test, as this can affect your fluency score. Overall, a good foundation, focus on linking your thoughts and adding a bit more detail.
