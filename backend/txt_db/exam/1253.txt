Question 
Tell me about your hobbies or things you enjoy doing in your free time. For example, do you watch TV, go to cafes, or use social media? Describe your habits and experiences related to these activities.

Answer 
I watch TV about once a week. I usually watch them with my friends. I usually go to the cafe to hang out with my friends. My favorite menu item to order is Cafe Latte. The most memorable experience was when I visited a famous cafe in Paris. The first time I went to a cafe was when I was 20 years old. The social network I like the most is Twitter. I usually visit the site before I go to bed. It's my favorite social network because it's very easy to use. I started visiting this blog to learn how to cook.

Feedback 
Your answer provides good detail on several topics. You correctly use present tense for habits ('I watch', 'I usually go') and past tense for specific past events ('visited', 'went'). Good use of phrases like 'hang out with' and 'memorable experience'. A minor point: 'I usually watch them with my friends' could be 'I usually watch it with my friends' or 'I usually watch TV with my friends' as 'TV' is often treated as a singular concept. The last sentence about the blog is grammatically correct but introduces a new topic somewhat abruptly; consider adding a transition if connecting it to the previous points.
