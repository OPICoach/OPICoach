Question 
Tell me about your hobbies and interests.

Answer 
I usually listen to music when I work. I play music on my MP3 player. I first became interested in this type of music when I saw a performance on TV. This song means a lot to me because it helped me get through a difficult time. My favorite dish to make is ramen. I usually cook in the morning. I started cooking when I was 10 years old. The problem was that I overcooked the noodles. I played basketball for the first time when I was 11 years old. It was pretty hard to learn.

Feedback 
Your answer covers a good range of topics (music, cooking, basketball), which is excellent for demonstrating your ability to discuss different subjects. Your sentences are clear and grammatically sound for the most part. To enhance the flow and coherence of your response, consider using transition words or phrases when moving from one topic to the next (e.g., "Moving on to another hobby...", "Besides music..."). The sentence "The problem was that I overcooked the noodles" is a bit abrupt after mentioning you started cooking at 10. You could integrate it more smoothly, perhaps by saying "When I first started cooking at 10, a common problem was overcooking the noodles," or "One challenge I faced when learning to cook was overcooking the noodles."
