Question 
Tell me about your hobbies and leisure activities, including any travel you enjoy.

Answer 
I jog with my friends. When I go for a walk, I always bring my MP3 player. When you go walking, you should wear shoes that fit well. I first became interested in walking when I decided to lose some weight. I enjoy traveling to the beach. I like going there because there are a lot of tourist attractions. Before a trip, I usually plan my budget. I make sure to bring my camera. Before I go on a business trip, I pack everything that I will need. I make sure to bring my laptop computer.

Feedback 
Overall, your answer provides several points about your hobbies and travel habits. The sentences are generally clear and easy to understand. You use appropriate vocabulary for the topics discussed, such as 'MP3 player', 'tourist attractions', 'plan my budget', and 'business trip'.

Specific feedback on sentences and words:
- "I jog with my friends." - Good, simple start.
- "When I go for a walk, I always bring my MP3 player." - Correct use of 'when' clause and 'always'.
- "When you go walking, you should wear shoes that fit well." - This sentence shifts from talking about yourself ('I') to giving general advice ('you'). In an OPIc answer about yourself, it's better to stick to your own experiences and habits. You could say, for example, "When I go walking, I make sure to wear shoes that fit well." or "Wearing shoes that fit well is important for me when I walk."
- "I first became interested in walking when I decided to lose some weight." - Good use of past tense ('became', 'decided') to explain the origin of your interest.
- "I enjoy traveling to the beach." - Correct use of the gerund 'traveling' after 'enjoy'.
- "I like going there because there are a lot of tourist attractions." - Good use of 'because' to explain the reason. 'a lot of' and 'tourist attractions' are appropriate.
- "Before a trip, I usually plan my budget." - Correct use of 'before' clause and 'usually'. 'plan my budget' is a good phrase.
- "I make sure to bring my camera." - 'make sure to' is a useful phrase.
- "Before I go on a business trip, I pack everything that I will need." - 'Before I go on a business trip' is good. 'everything that I will need' is grammatically correct but slightly wordy. More natural phrasing would be "everything I need" or "everything I'll need."
- "I make sure to bring my laptop computer." - Repetition of 'make sure to bring'. 'laptop computer' is fine, but 'laptop' is sufficient and more common.

Suggestions for improvement:
1.  Maintain a consistent perspective (use 'I' throughout when talking about yourself).
2.  Connect your ideas more smoothly. The transition from walking/jogging to travel is a bit abrupt. You could add a sentence like "Besides exercising, I also enjoy traveling." or "Another hobby of mine is traveling."
3.  Expand on some points. For example, what kind of tourist attractions do you like at the beach? What do you pack for a non-business trip besides a camera? What do you do while jogging with friends?
4.  Vary sentence structure slightly to make the answer more dynamic.
