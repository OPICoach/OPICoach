Question 
Tell me about your daily routine or some recent activities.

Answer 
Well, recently I've been quite busy. In this class, I did a project about consumer trends. Everyone in the class enjoyed his lecture, which was helpful for the project. I also went to a concert last month. Natalie Portman had the leading role in a short film shown before the main act. It was unexpected. Speaking of daily life, when I am at home, I have to clean my room. To be healthy, people should get enough exercise, so I try to go jogging. When you go jogging, you should drink lots of water. You should also take occasional breaks throughout the day, especially when studying or working. Sometimes, for special events or work, we have to dress in formal business attire.

Feedback 
Your answer uses a good variety of sentences covering different topics like classes, hobbies, and daily life. Individual sentences are grammatically correct and use appropriate vocabulary (e.g., 'consumer trends', 'leading role', 'occasional breaks', 'formal business attire'). To improve, focus on smoother transitions between these different topics to make the answer flow more naturally. For example, you could connect the class project to how you relax afterwards, or link daily chores to your health habits.
