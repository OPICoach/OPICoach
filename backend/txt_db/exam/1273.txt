Question 
Tell me about yourself.

Answer 
I prefer to go to the ABC theater because it's never crowded. I started cooking when I was 10 years old. It was the most enjoyable vacation ever. It made the room brighter. I like many actors, but I like Natalie Portman the best. Every summer is hotter than the last one. Listening to this song made me feel better. The most memorable event for me was the campus festival. At night, I have to turn on the air conditioner. My company was established in 1984.

Your sentences are grammatically correct and use appropriate vocabulary. You demonstrate a good command of various structures, including preferences ("prefer to"), past experiences ("started cooking when I was 10", "was the most enjoyable vacation", "made me feel better", "was the campus festival", "was established in"), comparisons and superlatives ("hotter than the last one", "like Natalie Portman the best", "most enjoyable", "most memorable"), and daily habits/necessities ("have to turn on the air conditioner"). Each sentence is well-formed individually. For a coherent OPIc answer, you would need to connect these ideas more smoothly and logically, perhaps focusing on one or two related topics per response, unless the question specifically asks for a variety of points. However, the individual sentences show strong foundational skills.
