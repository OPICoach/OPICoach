Comparison phrases: way better than before, Nowadays you can easily find... online. Useful structures: It's a bit hard to explain in detail, but..., the biggest difference is the advanced systems, when it comes to..., as I mentioned earlier/before, various spaces like..., not only from libraries but also from subway stations. Vocabulary: sign up/register, request, pick up, return, large machine installed, really handy (instead of useful/convenient).
