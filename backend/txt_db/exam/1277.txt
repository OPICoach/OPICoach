Question 
Talk about a memorable or unforgettable experience you had while working from home.

Answer 
Yes, I have a memorable experience about work from home. When I work from home, one time I have a very important online meeting with my boss and colleagues. My cat, he is very cute, suddenly jumped on my desk and walked across my keyboard. Everyone in the meeting see my cat! It was little embarrassing but also funny. Because I work from home, this kind of thing can happen. If I go to office, my cat cannot do this. It was unforgettable experience for me.

Feedback 
질문에 잘 답변하고 관련 경험을 구체적으로 설명했습니다. 몇 가지 개선할 부분은 다음과 같습니다.

1.  "a memorable experience about work from home" -> "a memorable experience *while* working from home" 또는 "related to working from home"이 더 자연스럽습니다.
2.  과거 경험을 이야기하므로 과거 시제를 사용해야 합니다: "When I work from home, one time I have" -> "When I *was* working from home, one time I *had*".
3.  "My cat, he is very cute," -> 관계대명사 "who"를 사용하거나 "he is very cute" 부분을 빼는 것이 좋습니다. "My cat, who is very cute," 또는 간단히 "My cat,".
4.  "Everyone in the meeting see my cat!" -> 과거 시제 "saw"를 사용해야 합니다.
5.  "It was little embarrassing" -> 관사 "a"를 추가하여 "It was *a little* embarrassing"이라고 해야 합니다.
6.  "Because I work from home, this kind of thing can happen." -> 과거 시제 맥락에 맞게 "Because I *was* working from home," 또는 일반적인 사실로 말하려면 "This kind of thing can happen *when you work from home*."이 더 자연스럽습니다.
7.  "If I go to office," -> 가정법 과거 또는 과거 시제를 사용하여 "If I *were* in the office," 또는 "If I *went* to the office,"가 적절합니다. 또한 "the office" 또는 "an office"처럼 관사가 필요합니다.
8.  "my cat cannot do this" -> 가정법 과거에 맞춰 "my cat *could not* do this"라고 해야 합니다.
9.  "It was unforgettable experience for me." -> 관사 "an"을 추가하여 "It was *an* unforgettable experience for me."라고 해야 합니다.
