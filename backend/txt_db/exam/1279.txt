Question 
Tell me about the concert venue you often visit. Where is it located? What does it look like? Why do you like that place? Please describe it in detail.

Answer 
Well um the concert place I often visit is um Seoul Arts Center which is the most popular and biggest concert place in Seoul. um it isn't close to my place. However, I can easily get there by subway because you know there's a subway station right in front of it. I like this place because you know they have really nice cutting edge facilities. The acoustics of the concert hall are literally the best in Korea. Plus you know they hold concerts and performances by renowned artists, you know. Well there's a few buildings for different kinds of concerts in Seoul Arts Center and there's a small park in the middle of the buildings. This park is a perfect spot to hang out with my friends or family after watching a concert. You know they have a small cafe in the park where I can grab something to eat or drink. um another thing that makes this place so attractive is the view and the music that I can enjoy at this cafe. So Seoul Arts Center is my go to concert hall for these reasons.

Feedback 
The teacher provides a template for describing a frequently visited place (concert venue, park, coffee shop, library, etc.). Key points include: 1. State the place and its general characteristics (popular, biggest). 2. Describe its location and accessibility (close/not close, how to get there, nearby subway station). Use contractions like 'there's' for fluency. 3. Explain why you like it, listing specific reasons (facilities, view, atmosphere, specific features like acoustics for a concert hall). Use phrases like 'cutting edge facilities', 'literally the best', 'perfect spot to...', 'grab something to eat', 'another thing that makes this place so attractive is...'. 4. Use connecting words/phrases (However, Because, Plus, So, another thing that makes...). 5. Incorporate fillers (Well um, you know, I mean) naturally without strong emphasis. 6. Use 'go to' as an alternative to 'favorite' for a more advanced vocabulary point.
