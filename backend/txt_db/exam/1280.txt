Question 
Many people put a lot of effort into keeping themselves fit. Is there anything special that you do to keep healthy? Tell me what you do and explain why you do it.

Answer 
I don't really do anything special for my health. And you know my life is like so hectic and I don't have much time to cook healthy meals or exercise. Oh yeah hey but there is one thing I always make sure to do. you know I try to drink as much water as I can.

Feedback 
This is a 'brain freeze' strategy. It shows fluency even when you don't have a specific answer. Key phrases: 'put a lot of effort into', 'keeping themselves fit', 'keep healthy', 'I don't really do anything special for...', 'my life is so hectic', 'I don't have much time to...', 'There is one thing I always make sure to do', 'as much water as I can', 'try to drink a lot of water', 'drink lots of water'. Use filler words like 'you know', 'oh yeah', 'hey' to sound natural. Fluency is key.
