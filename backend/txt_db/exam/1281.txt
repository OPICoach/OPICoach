Question 
before you travel what do you usually prepare for your trip? What things do you include in your luggage? Please list a few items you take with you.

Answer 
Well actually you know what? I don't really do anything special for my trip. Oh yeah and I think my life is like so hectic and I just don't have much time to prepare for it in advance right? And okay yeah but there is one thing I always make sure to do. I mean you know I just bring my smartphone.

Feedback 
Apply the same 'brain freeze' template. Focus on the core question 'what do you prepare?'. Key phrases: 'prepare for it in advance' (미리 사전에 준비하다), 'I just bring my smartphone'. Additional phrase: 'There is hardly anything I can't do on the internet' (인터넷으로 못 하는 게 거의 없다). Practice pronunciation of 'can't' (길게 발음). Use filler words like 'well', 'actually', 'you know what', 'oh yeah', 'I think', 'right?', 'okay', 'I mean'.
