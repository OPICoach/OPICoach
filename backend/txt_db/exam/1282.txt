Question 
Tell me about the last time you went shopping for clothes. So what did you buy? and who did you go with?

Answer 
Actually you know what? I don't really go shopping these days. You know? As I'm a job seeker my life is so hectic and I just don't have much time to shop in person. Oh plus there is hardly anything I can't buy on the internet. I mean whenever I need to buy things you know I just go online and get everything in just a few clicks.

Feedback 
This is a past experience question, but the template can be adapted. Key phrases: 'I don't really go shopping these days' (요즘 쇼핑 안 간다), 'As I'm a job seeker' (취준생이라서), 'shop in person' (직접 쇼핑하다), 'There is hardly anything I can't buy on the internet' (인터넷으로 못 살 게 거의 없다), 'whenever I need to buy things' (물건 사야 할 때마다), 'in just a few clicks' (클릭 몇 번만 하면). Use filler words and connecting phrases like 'actually', 'you know what', 'you know', 'as I'm a...', 'oh plus', 'I mean', 'whenever... you know... I just... and get...'. Ensure smooth transitions.
