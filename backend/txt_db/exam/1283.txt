Question 
Can you tell me about one of the major industries or companies in your country? How has this industry or company achieved such a high level of success? Please describe in details.

Answer 
Wow. This is a difficult question, but it definitely has me thinking. I would say one of the largest companies in the United States, which is where I'm from, would probably be Amazon. Now, Amazon started early compared to other countries and other industries in our country. They they started early online, um distributing out products. I believe they first started with books. They were a bookseller to people in the country, and they slowly acquired a variety of items, household items, just items every day that we would need. Similar to maybe Coupang. And then slowly it build momentum as people who lived in more rural areas or city areas who were either busy or too far, needed to receive those items. And they've built success through a variety of ways. One being the first company to really launch off from that standpoint. They also um have really they have really uh figured out the system of their workers getting products shipped and out of their uh out of their distributor really quickly. And they also have worked out other customer service as well. Though they have issues like every other country regarding their industry. Um, yeah, that was really long. That was like really detailed. Yeah. I got some information about Amazon.
