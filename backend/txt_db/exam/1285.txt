Answer 
Student answer not provided in the text.

Feedback 
The feedback recommends starting by acknowledging that there are many good parks (e.g., 'lots of great parks in my area just come to mind. So yeah, it's pretty hard to choose') before selecting one favorite to describe in detail (e.g., 'I would say Han River Park is one of my go to spots'). This follows the 'overall to specific' strategy. Suggested phrases include 'come to mind', 'it's pretty hard to choose', 'I would say', and 'one of my go to spots'. Various adjectives for describing parks are also suggested (e.g., nice, cool, awesome, amazing, beautiful, wonderful, lovely, picturesque, stunning, gorgeous, breathtaking).
