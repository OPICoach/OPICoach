Feedback 
For this descriptive question, the feedback suggests listing several major holidays first (e.g., 'I think Korean Thanksgiving Day, New Year's Day and Christmas are the most celebrated holidays in my country') and then explicitly choosing one to focus on for the rest of the answer (e.g., 'But Korean Thanksgiving Day is definitely the biggest one, so yeah, let's talk about it'). This allows the speaker to control the topic and avoid having to describe every holiday. Suggested phrases include 'I think... are the most celebrated holidays in my country', 'is definitely the biggest one', and 'let's just talk about it'.
