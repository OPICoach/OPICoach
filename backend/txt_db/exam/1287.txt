Answer 
Student answer not provided in the text.

Feedback 
As a practice example for descriptive questions, the feedback suggests starting by stating the traditional number of seasons (e.g., 'Korea has four seasons: spring, summer, fall and winter') but then narrowing the focus, perhaps due to modern climate changes (e.g., 'But because of global warming, it feels like we only have two: summer and winter'). The body of the answer would then describe the weather and activities for the chosen seasons (e.g., Summer: 'scorching hot and humid', 'which I don't really like', activities like swimming/surfing. Winter: 'It's freezing', 'I love this weather because', activities like skiing/building a snowman). Suggested phrases include 'scorching hot and humid', 'It's freezing', 'which I don't really like', 'I love this weather because', 'It's the perfect time for...', and transition words like 'on the other hand'. Conclusion strategies like asking Eva a question are also suggested.
