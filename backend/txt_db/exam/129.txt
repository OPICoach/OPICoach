Question 
What is the difference between a combo set question and a number 15 question?

Answer 
All right, one difference is that combo sets sometimes they have the news questions.

Feedback 
Your answer correctly identifies a potential difference. However, the sentence structure 'combo sets sometimes they have' is grammatically incorrect; the pronoun 'they' is redundant. It should be 'combo sets sometimes have'. Also, 'the news questions' could be phrased more naturally, such as 'news-related questions' or 'questions about current events'.
