Feedback 
Overall, your answer addresses the question well by mentioning both holidays and social gatherings. You included some good points like the cost of gifts. Here's some specific feedback:

-   **"Okay, um... when I think about celebrations in Korea, uh, there are some big holidays like Seollal and Chuseok, and also Christmas."**: Good start with hesitation and mentioning key holidays. Using 'come to mind' as suggested in the lesson ('When I think about X, Y come to mind') could make it sound more natural.
-   **"But, uh, I think more common are things like, uh, birthday party or wedding."**: 'Birthday party' and 'wedding' should be plural or used with an article if singular. 'Birthday parties or weddings' or 'a birthday party or a wedding'. The phrase 'I think more common are things like...' is okay, but 'I feel like [plural noun] are way more common' (as in the lesson) sounds more fluent and emphasizes the frequency.
-   **"People, uh, get together for these things."**: Simple and clear. Good.
-   **"If you are social person, you will busy attending many celebrations."**: 'Social person' should be 'a social person'. 'You will busy' is grammatically incorrect. It should be 'you will be busy'. The phrase 'be busy attending' is excellent and was covered in the lesson. So, 'If you are a social person, you will be busy attending many celebrations.'
-   **"Like, uh, wedding gifts or birthday presents, you need save money for this."**: 'You need save' should be 'you need to save' or 'you need saving'. 'You need to save money for these' (referring to gifts/presents) or 'for them' would be more accurate. Mentioning 'save up a lot of money for wedding gifts or birthday presents' (from the lesson) is a great way to make this point more detailed and natural.
-   **"Um, yeah, that's about celebrations in Korea."**: A bit abrupt as a conclusion. You could add a concluding sentence or transition, maybe asking the examiner about their country's celebrations as practiced in the lesson ('I wonder about celebrations in your country?').

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1.  **Vocabulary/Phrasing:** Incorporate phrases like 'come to mind', 'I feel like', 'way more common', 'outgoing person', 'be busy attending', 'save up a lot of money for...'.
2.  **Grammar:** Pay attention to articles ('a', 'an', 'the'), plural forms, and verb conjugations (e.g., 'will be busy' instead of 'will busy', 'need to save' instead of 'need save').
3.  **Fluency:** Practice linking ideas smoothly. While hesitation is natural, work on connecting sentences with transition words or phrases (like 'so', 'and', 'but', 'you know').
4.  **Engagement:** Try to sound more conversational, perhaps adding a slight smile or using intonation to express the 'funny' or 'challenging' aspects (like needing to save money). The suggested ending asking the examiner a question is also good for engagement.
