Question 
Can you tell me a particular holiday in your country? / Certain holidays are more important than others. What is the biggest holiday in your country?

Answer 
As I told you before, the biggest holiday in Korea is Lunar New Year's Day. It's the first day of the year in the Chinese calendar and it's a 3-day holiday. Families and relatives get together in their hometown and pay tribute to ancestors through a memorial service. During the holiday, we eat various kinds of food such as rice cake soup, which is a soup made with rice cake, and Korean pancakes. Oh, we also play traditional games such as a card game. We sometimes make a bet on getting a higher score. It's so much fun! We also bow to elders and get words of blessings and get pocket money. These are the activities we do on Lunar New Year's Day. Another big holiday in Korea is Chuseok, which is Korean Thanksgiving Day. It's a major harvest festival in Korea. I love both holidays.

Pronunciation: 'relatives' (not 'relatives'), 'through'. Vocabulary/Phrases: 'Lunar New Year's Day', 'Chinese calendar', '3-day holiday', 'get together', 'pay tribute to ancestors', 'memorial service', 'During the holiday' (use rising intonation), 'various kinds of food', 'such as' / 'like', 'rice cake soup', 'Korean pancakes', 'receive pocket money', 'bow to elders', 'get words of blessings', 'Korean Thanksgiving Day', 'major harvest festival', 'As I told you before', 'lots of' / 'a lot of' / 'lots and lots of', 'traditional games', 'card game', 'make a bet', 'getting a higher score', 'It's so much fun' (with emotion), 'These are the activities we do on Lunar New Year's Day'. Speaking Strategy: Prepare a storyline (intro, body, conclusion) in Korean first. Use present tense for descriptions. If the answer is too short or if asked a similar question, mention another holiday (Chuseok) or use 'As I told you before'. Use interjections like 'Oh' naturally. Keep game descriptions simple (e.g., 'card game'). Only use phrases that are easy to pronounce and remember ('입에 붙는 것'). Discard difficult phrases. Keep endings simple. Practice speaking out loud.
