Question 
I'd like to know about the hotels in your country. What are they like? Where are they located? Are there any special things about the services at hotels in your country? Please describe the hotels in your country.

Answer 
Hotels are very similar no matter where you go. For one, hotels are mostly located in popular vacation spots, tourist attractions, or historic sites. Plus, the prices near these places are somewhat high. Some popular hotels are fully booked during the peak season. What's more, most hotels have great facilities such as swimming pools, gyms, business centers, and fancy restaurants. Also, hotels in this area mostly have great views. Meanwhile, there are hotels in big cities as well. These days, some people prefer to spend their vacation at the hotels nearby. They don't want to get away for their vacation because traveling can be tiring. They just want to have a good rest. At these hotels, people can enjoy swimming and sunbathing at the pool. Some hotels hold special weekend parties. Also, most of these hotels offer special services and programs for those who want to spend their vacation at the hotels, such as live music performances. I think hotels are not just places where you stay at a night at a vacation spot. It could be a place where you can have a good rest. I think all in all, this is all I can say about the hotels in Korea.

Use connecting words like 'For one', 'Plus', 'What's more', 'Also', 'Meanwhile', 'All in all' to structure the answer. Use filler words like 'You know', 'Um' for fluency. Use diverse vocabulary like 'mostly', 'somewhat high', 'fully booked', 'peak season', 'great facilities', 'fancy restaurants', 'great views', 'nearby', 'get away', 'tiring', 'have a good rest', 'sunbathing', 'hold special weekend parties', 'offer special services and programs', 'live music performances'. Use phrases like 'No matter where you go', 'Vacation spots', 'Tourist attractions', 'Historic sites'. Pay attention to pronunciation and intonation, especially stressing main verbs after 'can' (e.g., 'can enjoy', 'can have') and avoiding stress on prepositions (e.g., 'at these hotels'). Aim for paragraph-level answers.
