Question 
Why do we have global warming?

Answer 
The light from the sun heats the earth. Heat from the sun is trapped mainly by four gases in our atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, and ozone. Also known as the greenhouse gases. When we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, it releases too much carbon dioxide. Too much carbon dioxide means too much heat is getting trapped. But if there's too much, then it can hurt the environment and the gases are no longer balanced. And of course, too much carbon dioxide means too much heat is getting trapped and that's why the temperature keeps increasing. That is global warming.

Feedback 
'trapped' means the heat is preserved or doesn't escape. 'fossil fuels' include coal, oil, and natural gas. 'releases' means emits. 'too much' indicates an excess that causes harm and imbalance. 'that's why' indicates the result or reason.
