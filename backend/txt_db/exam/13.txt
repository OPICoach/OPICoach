Question 
Tell me about the last time you bought a new piece of clothing. What did you need and where did you find it? Were there any challenges or problems? Give me all the details of the story.

Answer 
Last month I bought a T-shirt online. But you know, I was so annoyed. Because the wrong color of the T-shirt was delivered.

Feedback 
'Last month I bought a T-shirt online' is very good and direct. 'But you know, I was so annoyed' is a good use of filler and emotion. 'Because the wrong color of the T-shirt was delivered' is grammatically awkward; better to say 'Because they delivered the wrong color' or 'they sent the wrong color' (they refers to the online store/people). Use the root word strategy: if you used 'annoyed', use 'annoying' in the body (e.g., 'When I opened up the package, oh, it was so annoying'). Remember 'I was so annoying' means you bother others, while 'I was so annoyed' means you felt bothered. Combine 'annoying' with adverbs like so, very, truly, extremely, unbelievably.
