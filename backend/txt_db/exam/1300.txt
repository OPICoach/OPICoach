Question 
I'd like to know about a memorable experience you've had on a holiday. When was it and who were you with? What made that experience so special? Describe in details.

Answer 
A memorable experience on a holiday? Um, let me think. Oh yeah, I remember a time when I went to ABC Hotel on Christmas Eve. You know, my best friend Jenny and I wanted to do something special for Christmas. So we decided to go to a hotel and spend holidays together. Well, let me tell you about what it was like there. You well, you know what? ABC Hotel was a very nice five-star hotel in downtown Seoul. So the city view from the room was really incredible. In addition, the hotel lobby was nicely decorated with Christmas trees. And the smell of the hotel was so lovely. Actually, what made the hotel so memorable was their excellent food and great facilities. I mean, the dinner buffet at the hotel was absolutely delicious. I had such a great meal catching up with my friend. What's more, later that night, we swam in the pool, walked around the hotel, and just relaxed and watched our favorite movie in the room. I remember the room was very cozy and comfortable. Well yeah, I guess we didn't do anything special. But I can say it was a relaxing and fun holiday with my best friend. Personally, I think ABC Hotel in Seoul is one of the nicest hotels I've ever been.
