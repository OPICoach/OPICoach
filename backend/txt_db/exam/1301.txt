Feedback 
These phrases are useful for OPIc trend/activity questions ('What do you usually do?', 'Describe the activities you like to do'). They help make answers more detailed and less monotonous, which is important for higher scores (IH-AL). Specific points: 'Hang out' means spending time. 'Time' can take 'a/an' when modified (e.g., 'a good time'). Use 'in' with 'bed' (lie in bed) and 'on' with 'couch' or 'sofa' (lie on the couch). Pronunciation tips: R in Rest, '어' sound in 'on the couch', '취' sound in 'Chill'. 'Music' is uncountable, use 'a lot of music'. 'Songs' are countable, use 'a lot of songs'. 'Binge-watch' means watching many episodes consecutively. Remember to change verbs to past tense (e.g., took a nap, got some sleep, ate a lot, got some food delivered) when describing past experiences.
