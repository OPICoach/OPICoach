Question 
How has the way people bought food changed over the years? Where did people use to purchase food in the past and where do they purchase it now? Describe in details.

Answer 
Oh wow, oh my gosh, oh my goodness. This is a very difficult question. This is a really hard question/topic. Well honestly, I have no idea about this topic. I mean, I haven't thought about it. This is something I've never thought about, you know. I haven't watched any news related to this topic. I hardly watch the news these days. So I'm not sure what to say about the past. But I know that many people buy food online nowadays. Yeah, I mean, these days people do literally everything on the internet, not to mention grocery shopping. Speaking of purchasing food, Although there are many nice grocery stores, a lot of people prefer to buy things online. I think this is because it's a lot easier and faster. You just need to click a few buttons on your phone or computer, and the next morning you'll get your groceries delivered. I guess that's all I can say about this topic. I'm gonna have to say things have become more convenient nowadays thanks to the internet. Well, that's pretty much it.

Feedback 
The question asks about changes over the years, comparing past and present food purchasing methods. It's a high-difficulty question often appearing in later sections (14/15) for higher levels (IH, AL). It requires comparing past and present (compare and contrast) and discussing issues/problems related to the topic (though the provided answer focuses on the first part of the question). It's okay to admit the question is difficult or that you haven't thought about it. Use fillers like 'oh wow', 'oh my gosh', 'oh my goodness' naturally to express surprise or difficulty. Use phrases like 'This is a very difficult question' or 'This is a really hard question/topic'. To say you don't know or haven't thought about it, use phrases like 'I have no idea about this topic', 'I don't know much about this/this topic', 'I have no idea about this', 'I'm not really sure what to say'. To express not having thought about it, use 'I haven't thought about this topic' or 'I've never thought about this/this is something I've never thought about'. You can also mention lack of interest ('I'm not so interested in this topic') or lack of relevant experience (e.g., 'I don't even recycle' for recycling topic). When discussing the past, use varied phrases like 'a long time ago', 'back in the day', 'when I was young/younger/a child/a kid', 'as a child/kid/teenager'. Use 'used to' for past habits ('I didn't use to...'). When discussing the present/recent times, use 'these days', 'nowadays', 'lately'. It's strategic to focus more on the present if you're unsure about the past. Use phrases like 'So I'm not sure what to say about the past' to transition. Use 'buy food online' or 'buy things online'. 'On the internet' is also a good phrase. 'Literally' is a useful word for emphasis, especially for AL candidates. 'Not to mention' is good for adding something obvious or important to a list. 'Speaking of...' is a useful transition phrase. 'Grocery shopping' is a good term for buying food/groceries. Use 'I think this is because...' to explain reasons. Use 'a lot' before comparative adjectives (easier, faster) for emphasis ('a lot easier and faster'). Use 'You just need to...' to describe simple actions. 'Get... delivered' is a useful phrase for receiving items. For the conclusion, use phrases like 'I guess that's all I can say about this topic' or 'That's pretty much it'. Pay attention to tense accuracy and variety. The question uses 'How has... changed', which is present perfect. Using present perfect in your answer, like 'things have become more convenient', is good for showing changes over time that affect the present. OPIc is lenient on minor grammar errors but dislikes tense/verb form mistakes and prefers tense variety. Aim for natural delivery, using fillers like 'yeah', 'I mean', 'so' casually. Don't sound overly memorized. Pronunciation tips: 'news' (nooz), 'on' (ahn), 'haven't thought' (pronounce without the second 't'). It's better to say a few sentences accurately and naturally than many sentences with errors.
