Question 
Can you tell me about the public transportation system in your country? Which type of transportation do you use the most and why? Give me as many details as possible.

Answer 
In Korea, we have various types of public transportation such as buses, subways, and taxis. As for me, I prefer to use the subway most frequently. First of all, it's the fastest transportation option available. Actually, it's always crowded with people, and I get stuck in the middle of them, which I hate. But there is no choice, especially during busy mornings. There is no traffic jam, and no need to worry about being late for work or school, right? Oh yeah, another advantage is that it's a very affordable means of transportation. As a ticket costs only around a dollar, it's pretty reasonable compared to taking taxis or other options. What I'm trying to say is that it saves me a lot of time and money. And that's why I prefer to take the subway.
