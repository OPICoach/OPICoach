Question 
When was the first time you did recycling? How has the process of recycling changed from the past?

Answer 
Um, this question is very difficult but I will try my best to answer. I think there have been a lot of changes in recycling. For example, when I was young, there was no recycling site and many people didn't do recycling at all. But now, the rules for recycling are very strict. There is a set date and set time. If I don't do it right, I get a fine. Oh, and there is a recycling site in each area. I personally think that these are the biggest changes in recycling.
