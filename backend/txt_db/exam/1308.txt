Question 
Do you remember the neighborhood you lived when you were young? How is the neighborhood like today? compare and contrast some differences that you see

Answer 
Well, the neighborhood I'm living in right now is very different from my old neighborhood. When I was young, I lived in the countryside. So the places I can go to were very limited. And it took ages to get to a convenience store. Now I live in the downtown of [City Name]. So everything is new to me. And it's very different from my old neighborhood because everything is located within walking distance from my house. For example, a convenience store is only a minute walk from my house. So it's super convenient. But I have to say, I miss my old neighborhood.

Feedback 
Start with a filler like 'Well' to sound natural. When talking about the past (when you were young), use the past tense. Past tense verbs like 'lived' often have a silent 'd' sound. Intonation: Raise the end slightly on introductory phrases like 'When I was young'. Use expressions like 'it took ages to' for emphasis on duration. Use 'within walking distance' to describe proximity. Use 'It's only a minute walk' for specific distance. Use 'super convenient' for emphasis. Use 'I have to say' to introduce your opinion or feeling. Clearly separate past (countryside, limited, took ages) and present (downtown, everything new, within walking distance, convenient) situations. Make the past and present scenarios totally different for a clear comparison. Using examples like the convenience store makes your answer more convincing. Ensure correct pronunciation of 'walking' (not 'working').
