Question 
Tell me about the banks in your country. Where are they located? When do they open and close? What do they look like? Please describe in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
well, um banks in my country, huh? Okay. Yeah, honestly, you know, I don't really go there because um I do everything on my smartphone, right? Okay. So and all, you know, there are banking apps and all. But okay, when it comes to physical banks, um it's super easy to find them in big cities like Seoul, you know, every few blocks or so. And yeah. Okay. Their business hours are usually from um 9am to 4pm. Yeah, I think that's pretty much it for this question. Eva, I personally recommend using online banking um over physical banks. You know, it's way more convenient.
