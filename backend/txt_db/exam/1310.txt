Question 
What are the future implications of global warming?

Answer 
It is however becoming ever clearer that global warming is changing the planet at an ever increasing pace. And if we ignore the causes, It will be a very different planet that our descendants will inherit.

Feedback 
'ever clearer' means becoming more certain or obvious. 'at an ever increasing pace' means at a continuously faster speed. 'ignore the causes' means neglecting the reasons for global warming. 'descendants will inherit' means future generations will receive the planet.
