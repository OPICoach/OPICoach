Question 
Have there been any changes to the banks in your country since you were a child? How were they in the past? Um how are they now? Please describe the changes in detail.

Answer 
You know what? Um I think there have been so many changes in banks in my country. Well, first of all, you know? Well, back in the day, um almost like 10 years ago. Yeah. Well, there was no such thing as an online banking system. Yeah. Can you believe this? Right. It was such a hassle and a waste of time. Because you had to visit banks for every little thing, right? Like opening an account or making simple money transfers, you know? But um these days, yeah. Ah, you're right. We all have smartphones and no need to go to banks, right? Okay. And just a few clicks, and just a few clicks, wherever you are, you can do all bank transactions, right? Yeah, it's so convenient and time saving, right?
