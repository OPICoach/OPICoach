Question 
Tell me about the concert venue you often visit. Where is it located? What does it look like? Why do you like that place? Please describe it in detail. (Also implicitly includes the park question: You indicated that you like to go to parks. Please describe the park you often go to. What does it look like? Where is it located? Are there any special things about the park? Does it have any special facilities? Please tell me everything about your favorite park.)

Answer 
Well um the concert place I often visit is um Seoul Art Center which is the most popular and biggest concert place in Seoul. The place isn't close to my place. However, I can easily get there you know by subway because there is a subway station right in front of it. Well I like this place because you know they have really nice cutting edge facilities. The acoustics of the concert hall is literally the best in Korea. They hold concerts and performances by renowned artist. Well there are a few buildings for different kinds of concerts in Seoul Art Center. And there is a small park in front of the buildings I mean in the middle of the buildings. You know this park is a perfect spot to hang out with my friends or family after watching a concert you know? On top of that you know they have a small cafe in the park where I can grab something to eat or drink. So um another thing that makes this place so attractive is the view and the music that I can enjoy at this cafe. So Seoul Art Center is my go to concert hall for these reasons.

Adapt the general place description template for specific locations like a concert venue or park. Use specific vocabulary related to the place (e.g., 'acoustics', 'renowned artist' for concert hall). Use adverbs frequently for AL ('literally', 'totally', 'seriously', 'personally', 'actually', 'particularly', 'especially'). Ensure correct pronunciation of key words like 'concert venue', 'different', 'music'. Practice describing what you do at the place (e.g., 'hang out with my friends or family after watching a concert'). Remember to use connectors ('On top of that', 'So', 'another thing'). Use 'go to' for 'favorite'. Ensure grammatical accuracy, especially for AL ('for these reasons'). Use 'they' when referring to the venue/organization in speaking.
