Question 
When was the last time you visited the bank? What did you do? Who did you go with?

Answer 
As far as I can remember, the last time I visited the bank was a few days ago. I mean, I usually use the internet banking system instead of visiting the bank myself. But I needed some cash. So I went to the bank, filled out a withdrawal slip and waited for my turn. Because of COVID-19 pandemic, there weren't many people. So I didn't have to wait for a long time. I don't usually go, but whenever I go there, I think it's worth the time since the bank is really clean and offers great services.

Feedback 
This answer correctly uses the past tense to describe a past event. 'As far as I can remember' is a good filler for recalling past events. 'The last time I visited the bank was a few days ago' is a versatile template. 'I mean' is used as a filler. 'Internet banking system' and 'instead of visiting the bank myself' contrast online vs in-person banking. 'Needed some cash' explains the reason for visiting. 'Filled out a withdrawal slip' and 'waited for my turn' provide specific details of the action. 'Because of COVID-19 pandemic' adds context. 'There weren't many people' and 'didn't have to wait for a long time' describe the experience. The ending sentence uses the present tense ('don't usually go', 'go there', 'is really clean', 'offers great services') because it describes a general fact or routine, not the specific past visit. Maintaining correct tense is crucial.
