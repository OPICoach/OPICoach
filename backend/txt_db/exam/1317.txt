Question 
Have you ever experienced any problems at a bank?

Answer 
um oh yes. I once had a problem at a bank. I was on my way to meet my friends to go to a festival together. Then I remembered I didn't have cash. So I dropped by the bank to withdraw some cash. I inserted the card into the slot on the ATM and entered the pin by pressing the keys on the keypad. I got the cash. But the card didn't come out. I didn't know why it wasn't working properly. So I was already late for my appointment. I panicked. So I asked for help to a bank staff member. The staff told me that I can go and they will send me the new card to my home. So I think it was a very unpleasant experience.

Feedback 
This answer tells a story about a problem at a bank, using past tense consistently. 'um oh yes' is a natural way to start when recalling an experience. 'Once' is a good word to indicate a single past event. 'On my way to' is a common phrase for describing direction. 'Dropped by' means visited briefly. 'Withdraw some cash' reuses vocabulary from the first answer. Detailed descriptions like 'inserted the card into the slot on the ATM' and 'entered the pin by pressing the keys on the keypad' add realism but are optional if difficult. 'Got the cash' describes receiving money. 'Didn't come out' describes the problem. 'Wasn't working properly' explains the malfunction. 'Late for my appointment' describes the consequence. 'Panicked' expresses emotion. 'Asked for help' describes seeking assistance. 'Bank staff member' refers to an employee. 'Told me that' and 'send me the new card' describe the resolution. 'Unpleasant experience' summarizes the feeling about the event. Using a clear story structure (beginning, problem, resolution, feeling) is effective.
