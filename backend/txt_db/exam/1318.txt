Feedback 
The provided answer sounds like a memorized response, which is penalized in OPIc. To achieve higher scores (IH/AL), you should aim for spontaneous speech. Use fillers (e.g., you know, um, well) to sound natural. Connect your ideas smoothly using connectors (e.g., so, even though, in addition). Vary your vocabulary with descriptive adjectives and adverbs (e.g., unique, exotic, authentic, relatively, amazing) and use diverse expressions (e.g., I'm a huge fan of, cuisine, flavor) instead of simple words (e.g., delicious). Vary your sentence structures and subjects. Pay attention to pronunciation, especially word stress (stress main verbs, not be-verbs). Focus on flow (fluency) rather than speaking quickly. Phrases like "it's on the tip of my tongue" are acceptable when you hesitate. Use phrases like "as for" to introduce new topics naturally.
