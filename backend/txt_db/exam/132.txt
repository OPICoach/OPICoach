Question 
Tell me about your last experience at a bank. Tell me when it was, who you went with, and everything that happened at the bank that day.

Answer 
PE, 묘사, 과거

Feedback 
Correct. 'Last experience' is a big clue for Past Experience (most recent). 'Tell me when it was', 'who you went with', 'everything that happened' (happened ED) confirm it's past. 'Last' means 최근, not just 마지막.
