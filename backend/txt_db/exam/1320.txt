Question 
Reflect on a memorable experience when you were listening to live music. What happened? and when and where was it? Were you with anyone? What band or artist was performing? Why was it so unforgettable?

Answer 
All right. I still remember the time I attended my first concert. When I was a teenager, I was obsessed with this Korean boy group and really wanted to see them in concert. So you know what? I backed my parents for a ticket when I heard they were going to have concert. Honestly, I was very excited because I had never been to a live concert before. You know, it was a dream come true to see my favorite group in real life. And I was thrilled when they finally came on stage. As soon as the lights suddenly dimmed and they began singing, the audience went wild. You know what? Everybody in the audience was singing and screaming so hard. Also, their live performance was incredible. I mean, everything during the concert was perfect. So anyway, well, it was such a memorable time seeing my favorite group in real life. And well, it's been nearly 20 years. but I still remember the time very clearly.

Feedback 
The lecture provides a sample answer for a past experience question about listening to live music. It emphasizes the importance of using past tenses correctly and incorporating varied tenses like past perfect ('had never been'). The structure includes an introduction (when/where), body (details), and conclusion (memorable aspect). Specific phrases and words are highlighted: 'I still remember the time I + 과거 동사' is a useful structure for past experiences. 'Obsessed with' describes being a huge fan. 'Backed my parents' means begging them. 'Honestly' and 'You know'/'You know what' are presented as useful filler words for natural flow, with 'You know what' having an upward intonation to grab attention. 'Had never been to' demonstrates the past perfect tense, which is positively evaluated. 'It was a dream come true' is a common idiom for achieving a long-held wish. 'Thrilled' is presented as stronger than 'excited'. 'Went wild' describes the audience's enthusiastic reaction (like cheering/singing along). The past continuous tense ('was singing and screaming') is used to describe ongoing actions. 'Incredible' is highlighted as a versatile word for describing something great (performance, singer, dancer). 'I mean' is another filler for clarification or emphasis. 'So anyway' is suggested as a concluding filler. 'It's been nearly 20 years' uses the present perfect ('It has been') to connect a past event to the present, showing time passage. 'I still remember the time very clearly' is a good concluding sentence for memorable experiences. The lecture also advises that it's okay not to answer every single sub-question asked by OPIc, prioritizing fluency and natural delivery over completeness, especially for higher scores like AL. Correcting tense mistakes on the fly ('come, oh I mean came') is also demonstrated as a valid strategy.
