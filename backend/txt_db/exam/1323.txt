Question 
Tell me about what you did during your last vacation at home. What did you do on each day? How did your vacation start and what did it end? Please tell me everything you did on each day in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
Last winter I spent my vacation at home. You know but I can't remember what I did on the first and second days. I think you know I just like relaxed and lazed around. I think I had a like laid back staycation at home. Well um I ordered in food and played games and that was it. However I think you know I can tell you what I did on the last day. On the final day of my home vacation um I invited my friends over to my place. You know my two closest friends brought some food with them. Um you know we played games together and had dinner. After dinner we watched a movie like on Netflix. It was fun. After watching the movie we chatted over beer. I think it was the best home vacation ever. Um I had a great time relaxing at home but you know I don't want to like go to work the next day. Okay anyway I had a fun time with my friends on the last day of my home vacation.

Feedback 
Focus on using past tense correctly (spent, relaxed, lazed, had, ordered, played, invited, brought, watched, chatted). It's okay to say you don't remember specific details for every day (I can't remember it clearly, they don't stand out in my memory). Use descriptive vocabulary like 'lazed around' (빈둥거리다, AL level), 'laid back' (느긋한, AL level), 'order in' (배달시켜 먹다, AL level), 'invited friends over' (친구를 집으로 초대하다), 'chatted over beer' (맥주 마시면서 수다 떨다, AL level). Use fillers like 'you know', 'um' naturally. Ensure correct prepositions for media platforms ('on Netflix', 'on TV', 'on my cell phone'). Conclude with a summary phrase like 'It was the best home vacation ever'.
