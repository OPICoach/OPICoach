Question 
I would like to know about any special occasions or holidays you have celebrated with your friends or family. Please tell me which occasion you celebrated with them and what activities you did together.

Answer 
Oh I already talked about my birthday party with friends as an answer to the previous question. Can you give me one more minute to think? Um I think like this time let me tell you about how I celebrated Chuseok with my family. You know Chuseok is a big traditional holiday in Korea. Um usually families gather together to um enjoy special holiday food and spend time together. Anyway during last Chuseok My family and I prepared celebration dishes together. Traditionally we would make traditional dishes but this time we just made and enjoyed various tasty dishes. While cooking and having dinner together we exchanged all sort of stories and had a great time you know. I think last Chuseok was like all about enjoying tasty food with family. But it was um truly a precious time.

It's a good strategy to acknowledge if a previous question was similar and ask for time to think ('Can you give me one more minute to think?'). Use past tense for the specific event ('celebrated', 'prepared', 'made', 'enjoyed', 'exchanged', 'had'). Use present tense for general descriptions of the holiday ('is', 'gather', 'enjoy', 'spend'). Use vocabulary related to holidays and food ('gather together'/'get together', 'spend time'/'hang out', 'celebration dishes', 'traditional dishes', 'various tasty dishes'). Use 'tasty' as a good alternative to 'delicious' (pay attention to pronunciation 'delicious'). Use the pattern 'was all about ~ing' (AL level) to summarize the main point of the experience ('last Chuseok was like all about enjoying tasty food'). Use adverbs like 'Traditionally', 'truly'. Practice pronunciation of words like 'occasion' (어케이션) and distinguish between 'P' and 'F' sounds ('party', 'previous'). Ensure correct stress/강세 in words and sentences.
