Question 
Please tell me about an unexpected incident you had while preparing a meal. What were you cooking and what happened? How did you deal with the situation? Please tell me any incidents or difficulties that you had while preparing food.

Answer 
Um I think this question is not easy to answer because I don't experience any incident while cooking. Of course I've made some mistakes while cooking but I can't remember it clearly you know. They don't stand out in my memory. You know I'm just not good at cooking. So I often buy instant or frozen meals. Besides, I don't really enjoy cooking either. So if you're okay with it, Can I share a good experience related to food instead of an incident while cooking? Recently I went camping with my friends. Um none of us were good at cooking so we just bought ready made food for camping. While camping we cooked and enjoyed those meals and you know the result was like surprisingly good. Maybe you know we were just like too tipsy from all the beer we had. We kept saying how tasty the food was while having the best camping experience in a like a stunning landscape. Sorry Eva um I can't share any incident with you but this camping experience is all I have when it comes to food related stories.

Feedback 
It's acceptable to state that you don't have a specific incident to share and offer a different, related experience ('Can I share a good experience related to food instead of an incident?'). Use phrases like 'not easy to answer', 'can't remember it clearly', 'They don't stand out in my memory' (AL level) to explain why you can't answer directly. Use vocabulary related to food preparation and types ('instant or frozen meals', 'ready made food'). Use connectors like 'Besides' (AL level alternative to 'furthermore') and 'instead of'. Use past tense for the experience ('went', 'were', 'bought', 'cooked', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'had', 'kept saying', 'having'). Use descriptive adverbs/adjectives like 'surprisingly good', 'tipsy' (AL level), 'stunning landscape' (AL level). Use the phrase 'when it comes to ~' (AL level) to transition or conclude ('when it comes to food related stories'). Ensure correct pronunciation and intonation throughout.
