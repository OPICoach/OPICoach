Question 
Not provided in the transcript. The transcript uses TED talk excerpts for shadowing practice relevant to OPIc.

Answer 
When I was nine years old, I went off to summer camp for the first time.

Feedback 
This sentence is useful for describing past experiences in OPIc. The phrase 'When I was nine years old' is a good way to start. 'went off to' can be used instead of 'went to'. Pay attention to the intonation, like the rise on 'went off to'.
