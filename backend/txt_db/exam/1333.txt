Answer 
I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts including my beloved husband.

Feedback 
This is presented as a humorous line. 'I always like to say' is a useful introductory phrase. 'some of my best friends are extroverts' describes the speaker's friends. 'including my beloved husband' adds a specific example; 'beloved' means loved or dear. The instructor suggests using gestures while saying this.
