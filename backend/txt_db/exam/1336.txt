Question 
Technology is advancing more rapidly than ever. Can you tell me about the way technology has been changing? What changes have occurred since you were a child? Provide me with as many details as possible.

Answer 
I think there have been a lot of changes in technology. For example, when I was young, the cell phones were really big, heavy and the main functions were only calling and texting. But now it's like a small computer. It's much lighter and slimmer with amazing functions, like video chatting and online shopping and online banking. I personally think these are the biggest changes in technology.

Feedback 
This question asks for a past vs. present comparison of technology. Use past tense for descriptions of the past and present tense for the present. This type of question is common, especially at higher difficulty levels (5/6). You can structure your answer by discussing the past first, then the present, or by comparing specific items (like cell phones) across time. Useful expressions include: like (for example), I personally think, limited functions, ages and ages ago. The sample script compares old cell phones (big, heavy, limited functions like calling/texting - past tense) to modern cell phones (like a small computer, lighter, slimmer, amazing functions like video chatting, online shopping, online banking - present tense). It uses fillers like 'I think' and 'I personally think'. Remember to practice shifting between past and present tenses correctly.
