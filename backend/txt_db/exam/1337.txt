Question 
뉴스에서 본 recycling. 재활용 관련 이슈에 대해 얘기해보세요.

Answer 
Oh, seriously? Issues related to recycling? Wow. Well, this is something I've never thought about. Frankly speaking, I have no idea about this because I hardly read the news these days. On top of that, I hate to say this, but I'm not very interested in this topic. So, I can't think of any issues related to recycling in my country. Yeah, I'm sorry, but I really don't know what to say. So, I'll have to move on to the next question.

This is a strong example of using 'crisis escape sentences' when faced with a difficult or unfamiliar topic, as taught in the lesson. The answer effectively uses fillers ('Oh, seriously?', 'Wow. Well,', 'Yeah,') and phrases to buy time and express difficulty ('this is something I've never thought about', 'I have no idea about this'). Providing reasons for not knowing ('because I hardly read the news these days', 'I'm not very interested in this topic') adds detail and substance, which is good for higher scores. The transition phrases ('Frankly speaking,', 'On top of that,', 'So,') help connect ideas smoothly. The clear statement of inability to answer ('I can't think of any issues...', 'I really don't know what to say') and the intention to skip ('I'll have to move on to the next question') are delivered confidently, which is crucial according to the lesson. Ensure pronunciation is natural, especially for phrases like 'thought about' and 'can't think of', as highlighted in the video. Overall, this approach demonstrates fluency and strategic handling of a difficult question, minimizing potential score loss.
