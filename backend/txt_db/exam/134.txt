Question 
Tell me about your last experience at a bank.

Answer 
The last experience at a bank was two week ago.

Feedback 
'two week ago' should be 'two weeks ago' (add S). 'The last experience at a bank' is okay but 'My last experience at a bank' is much better and smoother. It was a bit long and not clean. Using 'My' is very good. To show it's spontaneous, you can say 'You know, okay, my last experience at a bank, okay, when was it? I think it was like two weeks ago and...'
