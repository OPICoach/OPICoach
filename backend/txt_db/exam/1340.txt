This is a description/explanation type question, often the first in a combo. You don't need to answer every single part of the question (e.g., favorite); you can talk about the most useful item instead.

Pay attention to pronunciation and stress for clarity (e.g., 'comfortable'). Vocabulary like 'take power nap' can be useful for AL.
