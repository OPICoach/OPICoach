Question 
In your background survey, you indicated that you enjoy going out for coffee. Please tell me about the coffee shop you often go to. Is it your favorite coffee place? If so, why do you like that place? Please tell me everything about the coffee shops you like the most.

Answer 
Well, um, yeah. um, you know, there is a Starbucks near my house, you know, which is so nice because it's within walking distance. So that's probably why I go there most often. You probably know like Starbucks always has a similar interior wherever you go. They look pretty much the same. So when you walk in, you see the counter and the menu and of when um of course, there's good smell of coffee. I think people love Starbucks for it's like welcoming atmosphere, which is why I often go there to study as well. The cafe has a really welcoming atmosphere. Every time I go to the cafe, I see people studying or working. Also, it's a nice place to hang out with friends or just like grab a quick breakfast alone. The local Starbucks near my place is pretty big. So it can get a bit noisy sometimes and they always have that like typical Starbucks music playing. Oh oh. But the best part is that I can just use the use the app to order. So it's super convenient. Have you used the Starbucks app ever, you know? Anyway, coffee shops are kind of similar anywhere. you know, so I don't think there's so much there's much more to explain about it, you know? So I think that's pretty much all I can say about it for your question.

Feedback 
This answer effectively describes the coffee shop, focusing on location, atmosphere, and features, avoiding discussing activities or past experiences which belong in later questions. Key strategies used include: 1. Natural start with fillers (`Well, um, yeah. um, you know`). 2. Using adverbs for natural flow (`probably`, `most often`). 3. Descriptive language (`within walking distance`, `similar interior`, `pretty much the same`, `welcoming atmosphere`, `cozy atmosphere`, `get a bit noisy`, `typical Starbucks music`, `super convenient`). 4. Using phrases to express reasons or results (`which is why`). 5. Incorporating common expressions (`hang out with friends`, `grab a quick breakfast`). 6. Using transition words (`Anyway`). 7. Natural ending phrases (`I don't think there's much more to explain about it`, `that's pretty much all I can say about it`). Avoid starting answers immediately; use fillers. Avoid repeating answers from previous questions. The bad example mixed description, routine, and past experience, which is off-topic for a description question. Vocabulary from bad example: `for breakfast or lunch`, `go out`, `eat out`, `work on`, `the other day`. Vocabulary from good example: `probably`, `most often`, `wherever you go`, `pretty much the same`, `walk in`, `counter`, `menu`, `smell of coffee`, `welcoming atmosphere`, `cozy atmosphere`, `which is why`, `hang out`, `grab a quick breakfast`, `local`, `get a bit noisy`, `typical`, `super convenient`, `have you used`, `kind of similar`, `I don't think there's much more to explain`, `that's pretty much all I can say`.
