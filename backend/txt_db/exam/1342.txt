I got a discount coupon from my go to online store. Um and I really want to get wanted to get those shoes because I love the design, you know? But before I got the coupon, the price had had been a bit too high for me. You know, thankfully, with the coupon, I got a 30% discount and that felt great because I was able to save some money. However, I was a little bit worried until the shoes arrived. I wasn't sure if the size would fit perfectly. Usually I wear size seven but they were sold out. So I went for a slightly bigger size. Anyway, they're a bit roomy. but still comfortable and fit my feet well. I wore them out yesterday. and my friends complimented the shoes which made me really happy. So that's my recent online shoe shopping story Eva. Yeah, that's all. I bought really nice pair of shoes.

Feedback 
This answer successfully addresses a recent shopping experience, even if it's for shoes instead of clothes, by asking for permission to slightly adjust the topic. Key strategies include: 1. Natural start and expressing preference (`Well, um I love shopping, you know?`). 2. Acknowledging the question and proposing a related topic (`I haven't bought any clothes lately. Well, I recently bought new shoes. So can I tell you about that?`). 3. Consistent use of past tense (`bought`, `got`, `wanted`, `had been`, `felt`, `was able to`, `was`, `arrived`, `wasn't sure`, `wore`, `complimented`, `made`). Past tense usage is crucial for experience questions. 4. Using specific details and vocabulary (`the other day`, `discount coupon`, `my go to online store`, `a bit too high`, `thankfully`, `30% discount`, `save some money`, `fit perfectly`, `sold out`, `went for a slightly bigger size`, `roomy`, `comfortable`, `fit my feet well`, `wore them out`, `complimented`). 5. Using transition words (`However`, `Anyway`). 6. Natural ending. The bad example was off-topic, discussing the advantages of online shopping in general instead of a specific past experience. Vocabulary from bad example: `I don't really go shopping often`, `I'm not that into shopping`, `be into`, `I'm not much of a shopping person`, `mostly do online shopping`, `compare prices`, `find better deals`, `offline stores`. Vocabulary from good example: `lately`, `recently`, `the other day`, `discount coupon`, `my go to online store`, `wanted to get`, `had been a bit too high`, `thankfully`, `got a 30% discount`, `felt great`, `able to save some money`, `worried until`, `arrived`, `wasn't sure if`, `fit perfectly`, `usually I wear`, `sold out`, `went for a slightly bigger size`, `choose/chose`, `go for`, `roomy`, `comfortable`, `fit my feet well`, `wore them out`, `complimented`, `made me really happy`, `recent online shoe shopping story`.
