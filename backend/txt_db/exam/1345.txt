Feedback 
This question is an 'experience' type, specifically asking about the reason/start of an activity. The key is to use past tense effectively for storytelling (1-1.5 minutes for AL). Avoid memorized answers; use fillers like 'you know' naturally. Use expressions like 'I've been' (present perfect) to show a continuous state. Use 'back then' instead of 'at that time'. Connect ideas smoothly for higher levels (AL). Use varied vocabulary like 'grab something to eat' instead of just 'eat'. Use connecting words like 'also'. Use expressions like 'feel like ing'. Summarize at the end.
