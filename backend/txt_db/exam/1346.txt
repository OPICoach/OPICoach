Question 
How did you first become interested in music? What kind of music did you like when you were young? Why did you like to listen to that kind of music? How has your interest in music changed?

Answer 
The example answer suggests starting by saying interest in music began since childhood. It mentions liking a specific genre (R&B) and a particular singer from the past, listening to their songs constantly and remembering lyrics. It connects these songs to childhood memories. The answer then includes a memorable experience related to music, such as a gathering with friends involving dinner, drinks, and going to karaoke to sing along to old favorite songs. Finally, it addresses the change in music taste by stating it has barely changed, but mentions being into a current outstanding Korean R&B musician.

Feedback 
This is an 'experience' type question asking about the reason/start and changes. Use 'I've been interested' (present perfect) to show continuous interest. Use varied expressions for 'like', such as 'I'm into', 'I'm a huge fan of', 'I'm crazy about'. Use 'as a matter of fact' instead of 'in fact'. Use 'all the time' for 'always'. Use 'remind A of B' to connect songs to memories. Use connecting words/phrases like 'so', 'after that', 'and then', 'anyway', 'speaking of' for smooth flow (AL strategy). Use 'sing along'. Incorporate adverbs like 'barely' and strong adjectives like 'outstanding' for higher scores. Avoid repeating 'my favorite'. Strategically reuse vocabulary learned from other topics (e.g., 'booked a table' from the 'reservation' topic).
