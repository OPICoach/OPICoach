Question 
I'd like to know about a memorable experience you've had on a holiday. When was it and who were you with? What made the experience so special?

Answer 
A memorable experience on a holiday? Well, um, let's see. I need a second to think about it. Oh, right. I remember a time when I stayed at Westin Chosun Hotel in Busan, Korea. So, it was about three years ago, during my vacation with my best friend. First of all, Westin Chosun was a very nice five-star hotel located by the beach. So, the ocean view from the room was really pretty. In addition, the hotel lobby was nicely decorated with flowers, and the smell of the hotel was so lovely. Actually, what made the hotel so memorable was their excellent food and facilities. I mean, the food at the hotel was absolutely delicious. There was a famous buffet restaurant where we went for lunch. My friend and I had such a great meal, sitting by the ocean. What's more, later in the afternoon, we swam in the pool, walked around the hotel, and just relaxed and watched a movie in the room. Well, yeah, we didn't really do anything special, but I feel like it was such a relaxing and fun vacation. I have to say, Westin Chosun is one of the best hotels I've ever been.

Feedback 
The feedback provides a template answer for a memorable holiday/travel/hotel experience, emphasizing that past experience questions are crucial (nearly 1/3 of the test). It suggests a structure: Introduction (acknowledge question, thinking pause, state topic with 'I remember a time when...', specify when and who), Body 1 (describe the place - location, features, using descriptive adjectives like 'very nice', 'pretty', 'nicely decorated', 'lovely', and connecting words like 'First of all', 'So', 'In addition'), Body 2 (describe activities/events, using connecting words like 'Actually', 'I mean', 'What's more', focusing on details like food ('absolutely delicious') and actions ('swam', 'walked', 'relaxed', 'watched'), with pronunciation tips for '-ed' endings), and Conclusion (summarize the feeling using phrases like 'I feel like it was such a...', and strong opinions like 'I have to say...' with structures like 'one of the best hotels I've ever been'). The feedback stresses consistent use of past tense, using connecting words for flow, varying speed and intonation for natural delivery, using descriptive vocabulary (amazing, incredible, marvelous, unforgettable), and adapting the template to cover various topics (beach, restaurant) by changing specific details.
