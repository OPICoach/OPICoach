Question 
Please tell me what you usually do at the park you often go to. Who do you usually go to the park with? Do you take a walk or ride a bike? Please explain what you do at the park.

Answer 
You know, there are a few things I usually do at a park. First of all, a park can be the best place to get fresh air. So, when I spend time outdoors, I go to the park in my neighborhood. In addition, I often take a walk or ride my bike. When I'm stressed out, I usually walk or ride a bike to relieve tension and clear my mind.

Feedback 
Remember that the specific questions asked by Eva (e.g., 'Who do you go with?', 'Do you walk or bike?') are examples and you don't need to answer all of them directly. Focus on natural pace and fillers. Key phrases to use include 'get fresh air', 'spend time outdoors', 'take a walk', 'ride my bike'. The phrase 'when I'm stressed out' followed by an activity and purpose ('to relieve tension and clear my mind') is a very useful line that can be applied to various topics (music, meeting friends, hiking). Note that 'outdoors' is an adverb and does not require a preposition like 'in' or 'at'.
