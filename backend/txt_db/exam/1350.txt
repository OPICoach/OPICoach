Question 
You indicated in the survey that you like to stay at home during your vacations. What kind of activities did you do during your last home vacation and when was it? Describe what you did in detail.

Answer 
My last stay at home vacation was a couple of weeks ago. It was a week long vacation. Right before the vacation, I was really tied up with work. So I desperately wanted to kick back and relax. Since I didn't want to do anything productive, I first slept in till noon and became a couch potato for a few days. I felt like a million dollars while watching TV with beers. Then I met my friends to catch up with each other's lives. We couldn't get together for a long time so we talked for hours and hours. My friends are good listeners and know every single thing about me so it was very comfortable sharing what happened. Before the vacation, I was really tired, worn out. So I spent every second of my last vacation relaxing. To me, my last stay at home vacation was the best vacation ever.
