Question 
These days, many people prefer to stay at home for vacations rather than going on a trip. What do you think the reasons are? Which one do you prefer and why? Please tell me in detail.

Answer 
These days, many people prefer to stay at home during vacation than going on a trip. I believe that there are several reasons for their preference. To start with, it's a busy life for everyone and people interact with other people 24/7. So they sometimes want to be alone and collect their thoughts. It's good for a change of air to stay at home. After resting for a few days, the worries are all gone and they feel refreshed. What's more, the rapid advances in technology has allowed people to do various activities they couldn't do before. For example, they can search and download movies and TV shows online and they can watch them anytime they want. Being a couch potato and catching up on TV programs they missed are good ways to let off some steam. I personally prefer to stay at home during my vacation because I'm living on a tight budget these days. I'm broke so I've been tightening my purse strings on every possible thing. I cannot afford to go abroad. But I believe what's really important is how they spend their vacation, not where they spend it.

Feedback 
This question asks about preference and reasons, covering both 'people' and 'you'. You should address both. The sample answer provides reasons for people's preference and then your personal preference. Useful patterns: 'stay at home during vacation', 'There are several reasons for my preference/their preference' (versatile pattern for reasons). Connecting words for listing reasons: 'To start with', 'What's more'. Reasons for people: 'It's a busy life for everyone', 'people interact with other people 24/7', 'want to be alone and collect their thoughts' (want 'me time'), 'It's good for a change of air' (good for a change), 'after resting for a few days the worries are all gone', 'they feel refreshed'. Reasons related to technology: 'The rapid advances in technology has allowed people to do various activities they couldn't do before' (versatile pattern), 'search and download movies and TV shows online', 'watch them anytime they want', 'Being a couch potato and catching up on TV programs they missed are good ways to let off some steam' (let off some steam = relieve stress). Reasons for personal preference (you): 'I personally prefer to', 'living on a tight budget' (have little money), 'I'm broke' (cute expression for no money), 'tightening my purse strings on every possible thing' (saving money), 'I cannot afford to go abroad'. Concluding thought: 'what's really important is how they/I spend their/my vacation, not where they/I spend it'. Adjust subject (I/they) based on the specific question.
