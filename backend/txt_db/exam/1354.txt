Question 
What kind of high is it when you're on stage and you look out and all you see are people?

Answer 
Oh it's I think it's but like you know how people say after you go on um a stage where you feel like you really interacted with the crowd um it lasts for a long time and it's really addictive. I totally experienced that this time. So after the show we drove back to LA and we were at our hotel room and I remember I just had to keep replaying it over in my head like again and again and it was like that was like the best feeling I've ever felt in my 22 years of existence. It's it's really really surreal. Like like it's it's so like life changing. I loved the whole experience. It's like so beautiful and everybody is just amazing. Like everyone in the crowd.

1.  **Movie Example:** 'I think it's like you know how people say after you see an amazing movie. Some movies can change your life. It's important to watch a feel good and happy film once in a while. It lasts for a long time and it's really addictive. I totally experienced that this time. My family and I saw a movie called Minari at a theater. It is a great family movie. It has a great cast. The movie has a good vibe. So after the show we drove back home and I was in my room and I remember I just had to keep replaying it over in my head again and again and it was like that was like the best feeling I've ever felt in my entire life. It's really really surreal. Like it was like life changing. I loved the whole experience. It's so touching and moving and every scene was just amazing. It was the movie that I will never forget.'

2.  **Concert Example:** 'I think it's you know how people say after you see an amazing concert. There's nothing like experiencing music in concerts. It lasts for a long time and it's really addictive. I totally experienced that this time. My friends and I saw a Blackpink concert at the Olympic Stadium accommodating approximately 20,000 people. The concert was so amazing that I couldn't stop thinking about it. So after the show we drove back home and I was in my room and I remember I just had to keep replaying it over in my head again and again and it was like that was like the best feeling I've ever felt in my entire life. It's really really surreal. Like it was like life changing. I loved the whole experience. It's so awesome and I couldn't take my eyes off even for a second. It was the greatest concert that I will never forget.'

3.  **Sunset Example:** 'I think it's you know how people say after you see an amazing sunset. The beauty of a sunset is unmatched and with each and every one comes in a peaceful way to end the day as well as the promise of a sunrise. It lasts for a long time and it's really addictive. I totally experienced that this time. After the sunset we drove back to the hotel and we are at the hotel room and I remember I just had to keep replaying it over in my head again and again and it was like that was like the best feeling I've ever felt in my entire life. It's really really surreal. It's it's so like life changing. I loved the whole experience. It's like so beautiful and the time I spent there was just amazing. It was the most beautiful thing that I will never forget.'
