I would like to know how recycling is practiced in your country. What do people specifically do? Tell me how things are recycled.

Answer 
description, habits

Feedback 
This is a Habit question. 'What do people specifically do?' is a big clue. 'Do do' means 똥 (slang, baby talk). Why habit? Because of 'do'. It asks how people do recycling, not just describing recycling itself. '하냐 뭘 하냐' is the clue. I have never seen a Description question about recycling. It's usually Habit, Past Experience, or Comparison.
