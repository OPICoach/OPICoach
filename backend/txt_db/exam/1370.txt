Question 
Could you please describe your bicycle in as much detail as possible? What does it look like? Where did you buy it?

Answer 
Well actually you know I don't have a bike but it's really okay because you know I can just use 따릉이 the public bike rental system in Seoul. You know what the best thing about it is it's convenience. um since it's easy to find 따릉이 stations all over the city you know I can rent a bike just anytime anywhere I want. um plus I can check the availability of bikes and stations nearby using the app 따릉이. um what else? Oh yeah the rental fee is quite reasonable. as it's just a dollar an hour. You know I can save a lot of money compared to taking taxis or using other forms of transportation. um I mean it's a very affordable way to get around the city. So you know um there is no need to have my own bike. OR Well that's why I'm using 따릉이 instead of getting my own bike.

The answer follows an MBC structure (Main Idea, Body 1, Body 2, Conclusion). The Main Idea is honest (doesn't own a bike) and introduces '따릉이' as a public bike rental system. Body 1 focuses on 'convenience', explaining ease of finding stations ('all over the city'), renting 'anytime anywhere I want', and checking availability via the app ('using the app'). Body 2 focuses on 'price', describing it as 'reasonable' and 'affordable' (e.g., '$1 an hour') and highlighting the benefit of saving money ('save a lot of money') compared to other transport ('compared to taking taxis or using other forms of transportation', 'get around the city'). The Conclusion summarizes the main point ('there is no need to have my own bike' or 'that's why I'm using 따릉이'). The answer effectively uses fillers (well, you know, um, oh yeah, I mean) and patterns (the best thing about it is, easy to find, anytime anywhere I want, there is no need to) for natural flow. Vocabulary like 'public bike rental system', 'convenience', 'availability', 'reasonable', 'affordable', 'compared to', 'transportation', 'get around the city' is used. Pauses and changes in pace are recommended to sound natural and not memorized. This answer can be adapted for the 'Past vs Present' question (Q14) by using the current description for the 'present' and adding a section about needing one's own bike in the past due to the lack of such systems, potentially including a personal example.
