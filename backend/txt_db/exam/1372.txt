Question 
Tell me about the banks in your country. What do they typically look like? Where are they usually located?

Answer 
There are many banks in Korea. Kookmin Bank is used by many people because it's very common, like Starbucks, making it convenient. If I need to go to the bank, it's usually nearby. The branches aren't always big, but their numerous locations make them convenient. Although I don't go often, it's good to know they are there when needed.

This is a Description category question. When asked about banks in your country, you don't need to describe all of them. Focus on one or two main points or one specific bank (Main Point strategy). Good phrases include 'There's a lot of banks here in Korea'. Using 'here in Korea' is better than just 'in Korea'. 'A lot of' is basic and can be used frequently, but advanced synonyms like 'tons of', 'loads of', 'myriads of', 'plenty of' should be used sparingly (once or twice) to avoid sounding memorized. Use fillers like 'but you know what', 'um', 'I think', 'in my opinion' (IMO), 'in my honest opinion' (IHO). Use 'we' instead of just 'Koreans' to sound more natural ('A lot of Koreans... we...'). Use adverbs like 'usually', 'frequently', 'all the time', 'never', 'tend', 'often' to describe habits or tendencies ('We tend to go to Kookmin Bank'). Using 'literally' can make a sentence more impactful ('it's literally everywhere'). Distinguish between 'convenient' (편리하다) and 'comfortable' (편하다). If you don't have much to say, a short, simple answer is fine; just conclude it cleanly.
