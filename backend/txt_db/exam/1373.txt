Question 
What do you do from the moment you walk into the bank until you walk out?

Answer 
Actually, I don't go to the bank much these days. But when I do go, I usually buy a Starbucks coffee to take with me. I do this because there's often a long waiting time, which I really dislike. While waiting, I don't usually use my phone; instead, I drink my coffee.

Feedback 
This is a Habit category question. You don't need to describe every single step. Focus on a specific routine or habit you have when visiting the bank. Good phrases include 'I don't usually go to the bank these days'. Using adverbs like 'usually' is important for describing habits. Mentioning specific details, like bringing a Starbucks coffee because of the waiting time, makes the answer more concrete and personal.
