Question 
When and where do you usually listen to music? Do you listen to the radio? Do you go to concerts? Tell me about the different ways you enjoy music. 음악은 언제 어디서 주로 듣나요? 라디오를 듣나요? 콘서트에 가나요? 음악을 즐기는 다양한 방법에 대해 말해 주세요.

Answer 
I usually listen to music when I am studying or working. It helps me focus and relax. I also listen to music when I am commuting or exercising. I rarely listen to the radio these days because I prefer to choose the music I want to listen to. I don't go to concerts very often, but I enjoy them when I do. I enjoy music in various ways, such as listening to streaming services, watching music videos, or singing along to my favorite songs.

Feedback 
Your answer is clear and directly addresses all parts of the question. You use appropriate vocabulary like 'commuting,' 'exercising,' 'rarely,' 'streaming services,' and 'singing along.' The sentence structures are varied and natural. Good use of conjunctions like 'because' and 'but' connects your ideas smoothly. The flow is excellent.
