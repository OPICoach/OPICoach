Feedback 
Absolutely easy, Comparison. 'How has the weather... changed over the years?' is a very big clue. It asks about weather 'when you were a child' and 'what it is like now', explicitly asking 'How was it different'. For Comparison, start with Present Only (MP). Talk only about the current weather first.
