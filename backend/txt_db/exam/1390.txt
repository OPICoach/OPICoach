Answer 
A particularly memorable time when I heard live music was when I went to a concert by my favorite band, Coldplay. It was in 2017 at the Olympic Stadium in Seoul. I went with my friends. The atmosphere was amazing, and the band's performance was incredible. The lights, the sound, and the energy of the crowd made it a truly unforgettable experience. They played all my favorite songs, and singing along with thousands of other fans was exhilarating.

Your vocabulary is strong, using words like 'memorable,' 'particularly,' 'incredible,' 'unforgettable,' and 'exhilarating' to convey your feelings effectively.
