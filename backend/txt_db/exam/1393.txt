Answer 
A memorable incident that happened at a coffee shop was when I accidentally spilled my drink on someone's laptop. It was a busy Saturday afternoon, and I was trying to find a seat with my coffee. I tripped over a bag on the floor and my coffee went flying. It landed right on a person's open laptop. I was so embarrassed and apologized profusely. The person was surprisingly understanding, and thankfully, the laptop was not damaged. I offered to pay for cleaning, but they said it was okay. I felt so relieved.

Feedback 
You tell a clear and engaging story with a beginning, middle, and end. You include all the requested details: what happened (spilled coffee), who was involved (you, the person with the laptop), and how you dealt with it (apologized, offered to pay). Your vocabulary is expressive ('accidentally,' 'spilled,' 'tripped over,' 'went flying,' 'embarrassed,' 'apologized profusely,' 'surprisingly understanding,' 'thankfully,' 'relieved'). The narrative flows well and uses past tense correctly.
