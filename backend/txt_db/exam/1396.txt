Question 
I'd like to give you a situation to act it out. You just moved into a new house and want to purchase some new furniture. Call a furniture store and ask three or four questions about some furniture you want to buy. 상황을 주고 연기해 보도록 하겠습니다. 새 집으로 이사해서 새 가구를 사고 싶습니다. 가구점에 전화해서 사고 싶은 가구에 대해 세네 가지 질문을 해 보세요.

Answer 
Okay, I will act out the situation. (Phone ringing sound) Hello, is this the furniture store? Yes, I just moved into a new house and I'm looking for some furniture. I'm interested in a sofa. Could you tell me about the different sizes and materials you have? Also, do you offer delivery and assembly services? What is the estimated delivery time? And finally, do you have any sofas that are pet-friendly? Thank you.

Feedback 
You successfully perform the roleplay situation. You initiate the call appropriately ('Hello, is this the furniture store?'). You state your purpose clearly ('looking for some furniture,' 'interested in a sofa'). You ask four relevant and well-phrased questions using polite forms ('Could you tell me...?', 'do you offer...?'). The questions cover practical aspects of buying furniture (size/material, delivery/assembly, time, specific needs like 'pet-friendly'). This demonstrates good functional language skills.
