Question 
That's the end of the situation. Have you ever bought furniture but had a problem when you got it? What was the problem and how did you deal with the situation? 상황극은 여기까지입니다. 가구를 샀는데 문제가 있었던 적이 있나요? 어떤 문제였고 그 상황에 어떻게 대처했나요?

Answer 
Yes, I have. Once, I bought a desk online, but when it arrived, one of the legs was broken. It was very frustrating because I needed the desk for work. I contacted the online store's customer service and explained the problem. They asked me to send pictures of the damage. After reviewing the pictures, they offered me a full refund or a replacement leg. I chose the replacement leg, and they sent it to me within a few days. It was a hassle, but the customer service was helpful.

Feedback 
You provide a clear account of a problem and its resolution. You state the problem directly ('one of the legs was broken'). You describe your feelings ('very frustrating') and actions ('contacted customer service,' 'explained the problem'). You detail the steps taken by the store ('asked for pictures,' 'offered refund or replacement'). The resolution is clearly stated. Vocabulary like 'frustrating,' 'customer service,' 'replacement leg,' and 'hassle' is well-used. The narrative structure is logical and easy to follow.
