Answer 
Public parks face several challenges these days. One major issue is maintenance and funding. Parks require regular upkeep, but budgets are often limited. Another challenge is overcrowding, especially in popular parks, which can lead to wear and tear on facilities and green spaces. Vandalism and littering are also ongoing problems. These issues are caused by factors like increasing urban populations, lack of public awareness about park etiquette, and insufficient resources for management. To address these problems, governments need to allocate more funding for park maintenance. Public awareness campaigns can help reduce littering and vandalism. Also, developing more green spaces or improving existing smaller parks can help distribute visitors and reduce overcrowding in popular areas.

Feedback 
This is a comprehensive and well-reasoned response to a complex question. You identify multiple challenges (maintenance/funding, overcrowding, vandalism/littering). You discuss the causes clearly (urban populations, lack of awareness, insufficient resources). Most importantly, you propose concrete solutions (allocate more funding, awareness campaigns, develop/improve parks). You use appropriate vocabulary like 'challenges,' 'maintenance,' 'funding,' 'upkeep,' 'overcrowding,' 'wear and tear,' 'vandalism,' 'littering,' 'ongoing problems,' 'urban populations,' 'park etiquette,' 'insufficient resources,' 'allocate,' 'awareness campaigns,' 'distribute visitors.' The structure is logical, moving from problems to causes to solutions. Sentence structures are varied and sophisticated.
