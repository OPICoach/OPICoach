Question 
How has the weather in your country changed over the years?

Answer 
The weather in Korea is colder than before.

Feedback 
The sentence is grammatically perfect, but not recommended for OPIc Comparison strategy (MP). 'Than before' already talks about the past. In the main point (MP), only talk about the present. This makes the contrast clearer later when you talk about the past.
