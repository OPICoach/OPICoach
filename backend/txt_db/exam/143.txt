Question 
Can you tell me about your house where you live now? How is it different from your old house where you lived before? Please compare your old house with your current house in detail.

Answer 
Alright so my family and I have lived in the same house for let's say almost 15 or 20 years. So I mean it's like whole history of of my family. And I I still love living in this house. But yeah, um it is already renovated to be honest. a while back before before my parents decided to renovate my this house. Um there was totally messy because all the stuff of my um family like history history memorial stuff like books and furniture and other things were were stuck everywhere. But um now, I guess um it totally changed. Everything everything were well organized. And for example, um our furniture were our furniture are built in. So yeah, I think it is way more clean and delicate. yeah, all right, so that is that is um how my how my house has changed for over decades. Okay, thank you for listening. Oh sorry.

Feedback 
The answer was too long (1 minute 49 seconds). Aim for 1-1.5 minutes per question. The score would likely be IL to max IM1 due to lack of focus and structural issues. Do not say "Thank you for listening" or "Oh sorry" at the end. The answer covered too many topics (house, neighborhood, city, transportation) instead of focusing solely on the house comparison. For the phrase "15 or 20 years," it's better to be more precise like "over 15 years" or "about 20 years." The SAT/SMART strategy was not clearly followed. The S (main point) should be short and focused (e.g., the house is clean). Extra details like living there for many years should go in the A part. For the comparison (M part), use the opposite of the S point (e.g., if S is clean, M should mention it was not clean or messy). Using "not that [opposite of S]" (e.g., "not that clean") is a good transition. The phrase "decided to renovate" is good, showing more detail than just "renovated." The description of the past house being messy with stuff "stuck everywhere" is good. Grammar correction: "Everything everything were well organized" should be "Everything was well organized." Grammar correction: "our furniture were our furniture are built in" should likely be "our furniture are built in" (assuming furniture is treated as plural here, or "is" if treated as singular collective noun, but "were" is incorrect for the current state). Overall, the attempt to use vocabulary like 'renovate', 'messy', 'well-organized', 'built-in' is good, but the answer needs better focus and adherence to the SAT/SMART structure for comparison questions.
