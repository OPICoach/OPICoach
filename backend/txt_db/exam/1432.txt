Question 
You told me about websites you often visit. How did you get to use the websites in the first place? What did you first do there? Tell me about how you first came to know the websites.

Answer 
I think this question is really difficult to answer because you know I can't remember when I started visiting the websites I use the most often. You know, I can't remember when I started hiking in the first place. But, one thing I can come up with is that I started visiting a website called Naver. Because, you know, it was the most popular one among my friends in high school. You know it's the most popular search engine in Korea. It's like the Korean version of Google. I can find all different kinds of categories such as the most recent news, um weather forecast, sports, movies and you know all other content. What's more, I can even shop on this website. It's like google plus amazon.com. This website is super convenient to use and you can get good deals here. On top of that, I remember I started visiting a website called ABC closet. My friend Julia recommended this online store because they have very chic style. As for Instagram and Facebook, I think I've used them because most of my friends have used them. To recap, I started using the sites because they're the most popular or my friend recommended them, you know.

Feedback 
Excellent attempt at answering a challenging 'first experience' question. You've incorporated many useful strategies discussed in the lecture.

**Strengths:**
1.  **Addressing the Question Directly:** You acknowledge the difficulty of remembering the exact start ('I can't remember when I started...'), which is natural and acceptable.
2.  **Using Key Phrases:** Phrases like 'in the first place' directly address the question's core. 'One thing I can come up with' (or 'think of') is a great pattern for introducing a specific memory, highly recommended for AL.
3.  **Providing Multiple Examples:** You didn't just stick to one website (Naver) but also mentioned a shopping site (ABC Closet) and social media (Instagram/Facebook). This shows you can talk about different types of websites.
4.  **Explaining the 'Why':** You clearly state the reasons for starting to use them: popularity among friends ('most popular one among my friends'), recommendation ('My friend Julia recommended this'), and general usage by peers ('most of my friends have used them'). This directly answers 'how you got to use' them.
5.  **Adding Details (for IH/AL):** For Naver, you described its function ('search engine', 'Korean version of Google') and the content available ('recent news, weather forecast, sports, movies, all other content'). For ABC Closet, you mentioned its style ('chic style') and benefits ('get good deals'). Providing such details elevates your response beyond a basic IM level.
6.  **Using Connecting Words:** Phrases like 'But', 'Because', 'What's more', 'On top of that', 'As for', and 'To recap' help connect your ideas smoothly, improving fluency and coherence (essential for IH/AL).
7.  **Using Fillers:** 'You know', 'um' are used naturally to sound more conversational and give you time to think.
8.  **Appropriate Vocabulary:** 'search engine', 'categories', 'weather forecast', 'super convenient', 'get good deals', 'formal outfits' (implied context for ABC Closet), 'chic style' are good choices. 'Super convenient' is informal but acceptable.
9.  **Summarizing:** Ending with 'To recap' provides a nice conclusion.

**Areas for Refinement (based on lecture points):**
1.  **Pronunciation Focus:** Pay attention to stress on auxiliary verbs. For example, 'I can find' should have stress on 'find', not 'can'. 'I've used' should stress 'used', not 'have'. Also, practice 'recent news' (not 'recent').
2.  **Past Tense Consistency:** Ensure all verbs referring to past actions (starting to use, what you first did) are in the past tense ('started', 'was', 'recommended', 'had to visit' - though 'had to visit' wasn't in your answer, it was in the lecture's example for school website). Your use of past tense seems correct here.
3.  **Consider 'happen to':** The lecture mentioned 'happen to use' for using something by chance (like Google when you needed to look something up). You could potentially add a sentence like 'Also, I happened to use Google when I had to look up something for school.'
4.  **Consider 'look up':** You could explicitly use 'look up' when mentioning searching for information, e.g., 'I used Naver to look up information' or 'I happened to use Google when I had to look up something.'

Overall, this is a strong response that demonstrates good control of grammar, vocabulary, and discourse management, incorporating strategies suitable for achieving IH or AL by providing details and using varied linking phrases.
