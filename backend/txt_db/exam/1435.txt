Feedback 
Feedback on the answer to 'What do you like most about it?': Focus on one main thing. Regarding the phrase 'go to home', it should be 'go home'. The phrase 'in the hometown' is awkward and should be 'in my hometown'. Also, practice using the '-ing' form (e.g., 'I love spending time') more often, as Korean students tend to overuse the 'to' form (e.g., 'I love to spend time'). While both can be correct, focusing on '-ing' will help improve naturalness.
