Question 
Have you ever made plans for a trip but had to cancel at the last minute because of something happened unexpectedly? What was the problem and how did you resolve the situation?

Answer 
Okay. A time when I cancelled a trip or an appointment? Well, I remember when I had to cancel a beach trip. It was during the summer break when I was in college. Yeah, kind of a long time ago. So let me tell you about what happened. So one day in the summer, I was supposed to go to the beach with my best friend. Our plan was to go to the beach on the east side of Korea and stay at a resort for two days. So we had already booked a room at a resort and we had been so excited about our trip. You know what? The night before the trip, it started raining a lot. All of a sudden, it was pouring and the rain didn't stop the next day. So guess what? Can you guess what we ended up doing? We decided to postpone our trip. Because, you know, how could we enjoy our summer vacation at a rainy beach? It was such a bummer that we had to cancel our trip at the last minute, especially because we had been looking forward to it. Well, instead of going to the beach, we just went to the movies and had a good dinner. Looking back, I think we still had fun hanging out that night. So anyway, it was a time when I had to postpone a trip because of the rain. Speaking of which, I feel like I want to go to the beach this summer. Maybe I should invite my friend.

Feedback 
This is a common past experience question, often paired with role-play scenarios. The answer follows a good structure: introduction (when it happened), problem (sudden heavy rain), resolution (cancelled/postponed the trip, went to movies instead), and conclusion (summary, future wish). Key phrases like 'I remember when', 'I was supposed to', 'our plan was to', 'it started raining', 'it was pouring', 'didn't stop', 'ended up doing', 'decided to postpone', 'bummer', 'at the last minute', 'instead of', 'went to the movies', 'had a good dinner', 'looking back', 'hanging out', 'postpone' are used effectively. The use of past tense is crucial and generally correct. For higher levels (AL), incorporating varied tenses like past perfect ('had booked', 'had been excited', 'had been looking forward to') and conversational fillers ('you know what?', 'guess what?', 'kind of', 'well', 'anyway', 'speaking of which') is beneficial. The feedback also suggests preparing alternative answers like stating you've never had such an experience and practicing with keywords rather than memorizing the full script.
