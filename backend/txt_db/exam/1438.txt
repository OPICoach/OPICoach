Question

Answer 
Suggested phrases and structures: - Introduction: "well um I think what people do to get a job has changed a lot over time." - Past preparation: "in the past academic backgrounds and um English scores were the most important." - Present preparation: "it seems that um you know practical skills and experience related to one's major are more important." - Current trends/changes (using present perfect): "lots of students spend their busy vacations doing internships, which has become more quite common." - Other current trends: "nowadays AI interviews are also quite common. So preparing for them seems essential."

Feedback 
This question asks for a comparison between past and present job preparation methods. The phrase "past five years" indicates the need to use various tenses, including past tense for the past, present tense for the present, and present perfect tense to describe changes or recent trends. Avoid starting your answer immediately after the question; use fillers like "well um" and hesitate slightly to sound natural. Practice the structure "what people do has changed a lot over time." Learn phrases like "has become common" or "has become better." Use introductory phrases for information you're not entirely sure about, such as "based on what I've heard" or "I'm not exactly sure but I've heard that." Practice using words like "seems" (e.g., "seems essential"). Focus on demonstrating your language skills through tense variety and structure rather than providing overly complex content.
