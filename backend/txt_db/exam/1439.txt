Feedback 
This question asks about a popular industry, its appeal, and related issues. It's acceptable to state that the question is difficult or that you lack knowledge; practice specific phrases for this, including conditional statements or explaining that you wouldn't know the answer even in your native language. If you choose to answer, select an industry you can discuss using relatively simple English terms. Avoid translating complex technical details. Use fillers and hesitate slightly at the start. Practice phrases like "As far as I know" and structures using "becoming" (e.g., "are becoming more popular"). Pay attention to pronunciation, especially for common words like "interested in" and "clothes" (/kloʊz/). A key structure to practice for AL is "What makes X so fascinating/attractive is...". Learn connecting words like "as for," "when it comes to," or "in terms of." Be careful not to pause awkwardly after "be" verbs. Practice using "have been trying to" for ongoing efforts. Learn useful ending phrases like "I wish I knew more about this, but what I want to say is..." Remember to use "social media" instead of "SNS" and "Gen Z" instead of "MG세대." Use "various" as an alternative to "so many kinds." Avoid common grammatical errors like using a noun directly after "when I was" (e.g., "when I was high school").
