Question 
What do you typically do when you stay at a hotel? Tell me the types of activities you do. When do you usually stay at a hotel?

Answer 
I usually stay at a hotel when I go abroad. I go there with my friend Clara because we both like traveling. However, we don't do much at a hotel since we spend most of our time sightseeing and visit tourist sites. And in addition, we love to spend time at a nearest beach during the day. When we come back to a hotel, we talk about the places we visited and I post a review on my blog using my laptop. Also, we enjoy the fascinating night view of the city. These are the activities I do when I stay at a hotel.

This question asks about your routine (루틴). Use the present tense for questions with 'typically' or 'usually'. Note that questions about the last time you did something will require the past tense. Use the pattern 'spend time ing' (e.g., 'spend most of our time sightseeing'). Use transition words like 'however' and 'in addition'. Describe activities you do (or don't do) at the hotel. Use descriptive words like 'fascinating' for views. Practice intonation, especially raising it before a main clause when using a subordinate clause first.
