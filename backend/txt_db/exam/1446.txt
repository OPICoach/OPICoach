Question 
Compare hotels in your country and those in overseas. Do they have anything in common? What are the differences? Please tell me in detail.

Answer 
As far as I know, there are some similarities and differences between hotels in Korea and those in overseas. What's similar is that they have almost same types of facilities. Every hotel has rooms, restaurants, and a bar. The biggest difference is restaurants in a hotel. Korean hotels have restaurants that provide traditional Korean food, but hotels in overseas have restaurants that sell local food. I think this is the difference between hotels in Korea and hotels in overseas.

This is a comparison question (두 가지 대상 비교하기), often appearing at higher difficulty levels (5 or 6). Structure your answer by discussing similarities first, then differences, and potentially your preference. Use fillers like 'As far as I know'. Use vocabulary like 'similarities' and 'differences' (or 'similar points'). Explain the points of comparison (e.g., facilities, restaurant food). List items with rising intonation (e.g., 'rooms, restaurants, and a bar'). Use contrast words like 'but'.
