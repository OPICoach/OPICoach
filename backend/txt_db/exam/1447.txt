Question 
In your background survey, you indicated that you like to go to the beach. Do you have any favorite beaches? Are there any beaches you often visit?

Answer 
Introducing a favorite beach (e.g., 협재 beach) and its location (southern coast, Jeju Island). Describing its features like crystal clear water, stunning/gorgeous/incredible shoreline, fascinating lava rocks. Explaining why it's special (unique charm, striking scenery) and its popularity (go-to spot, famous vacation spot). Mentioning how it makes you feel (instantly wash away stress, gives indescribable emotions/inspiration). Recommending the beach.

Feedback 
Use diverse vocabulary beyond 'very' and 'many' (numerous, incredible, crystal clear, stunning, gorgeous, striking, fascinating, unique, truly beautiful, tasty). Use varied expressions for 'favorite' (My favorite beach is..., The beach I like the most is..., My go-to beach is...). Explain what makes it special using patterns like 'What makes this beach so special is...' or 'This beach is very special because...'. Use expressions like 'It's no wonder...' to describe its popularity. Mention how the beach makes you feel (e.g., instantly wash away stress, gives indescribable emotions and inspiration). Use fillers and vary tempo for naturalness. Avoid overly templated answers. Practice paraphrasing. Use expressions like 'It's hard to put this into words' when describing feelings or unique features. When recommending, use correct grammar: 'recommend/suggest + -ing' or 'recommend/suggest + that + subject + base verb' (e.g., I'd like to recommend visiting this beach / I'd like to recommend that you visit this beach), avoiding 'recommend you to visit'.
