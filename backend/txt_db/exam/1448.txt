Question 
I'd like to know what you usually do at the beach. Who do you usually go to the beach with? Please tell me about the outdoor activities that you do at the beach.

Answer 
Start by saying you do many things ('I'm not sure where to start because I do a lot of things'). State the main reason for visiting (e.g., to spend quality time with loved ones/friends and family, and rest up). Mention available activities (swimming, surfing, camping) but emphasize simple relaxation and enjoying laid back time or leisure time. Describe how the beach helps with stress (rejuvenates, uplifts mood, relieves stress, wash away stress). Mention the beautiful landscape energizes you. You can also mention visiting a nearby seafood restaurant and how tasty the food is. Conclude by summarizing that beach trips are mostly about taking a break, relaxing, and relieving stress.

Feedback 
Use varied vocabulary (various, laid back, breathtaking, indescribable, truly/incredibly/absolutely beautiful, awesome, tasty, rejuvenate, uplift my mood, landscape, unique charm). Use patterns like 'I'm not sure where to start...', 'The main reason is...', 'While there are various activities..., I simply enjoy...', 'especially when I'm stressed, spending time at the beach always rejuvenates me', 'It never fails to uplift my mood', 'As I mentioned before', 'What's more...', 'Anyway my beach trips are mostly about...'. Avoid listing activities in a rigid A, B, C format. Focus on describing the experience and feelings. Use expressions like 'spend quality time' and 'rest up'. Differentiate between 'tasty' and 'delicious'. Use fillers and vary tempo for natural flow. Practice describing feelings and atmosphere (e.g., unique charm, breathtaking scenery, indescribable emotions).
