Question 
People prepare before they travel. What do you do to prepare for travel? Do you search for information in advance or make reservations? Please tell me everything about your preparation for a trip.

Answer 
You know, there are so many things I prepare before a trip. When it comes to getting ready for a trip, I always make sure to have all the things I need before I leave. I think doing some research about my destinations is what I always do first. Honestly, you know, making a plan for a trip always gives me a lot of joy. What's more, I always consider many options ahead of time. After doing some research, you know, I make reservations for my flights, like hotel rooms and like things like that, you know. So I think visiting a local restaurant is important for like satisfying traveling. So I sometimes ask my friends for restaurant recommendations, you know? Another thing I do before traveling is like making a packing list, you know? You know I'm a heavy packer, so it's necessary to decide what to bring before packing my bag to avoid making it too heavy. There is one more thing I never forget to do. You know I always look up most visit attractions and meticulously read online reviews. So I'd have to say that my trip preparation is always about like planning every detail ahead.

Feedback 
This answer effectively uses several techniques recommended for higher OPIc levels (IH/AL).

- **Fillers and Natural Pauses**: Starting with 'You know,' and incorporating fillers like 'like' and 'you know' throughout makes the speech sound more natural and less robotic, which is crucial for fluency.
- **Varied Sentence Structure**: Phrases like 'doing some research... is what I always do first' are more advanced than simple SVO sentences ('I always do research'), demonstrating better grammatical control and range.
- **Useful Expressions**: 'When it comes to...' is an excellent phrase for introducing a topic. 'Make sure to' is useful for describing necessary actions. 'Ahead of time' is a good idiomatic phrase for 'in advance'.
- **Adverbs and Adjectives**: Using adverbs like 'Honestly' and 'meticulously' adds detail and color to the description. Adjectives like 'satisfying' (for 'satisfying traveling') show a richer vocabulary.
- **Specific Vocabulary**: Terms like 'heavy packer', 'restaurant recommendations', and 'attractions' are specific and relevant to the topic.
- **Listing Techniques**: 'Another thing I do...' is a good way to transition between points and list multiple preparations.
- **More Complex Structures**: Using phrases like 'to avoid making it too heavy' shows the ability to construct more complex sentences, suitable for AL.
- **Concluding Phrase**: 'So I'd have to say that...' is a strong, conversational way to summarize or conclude a point.
- **Natural Hesitation**: Including examples of slight hesitation ('like things like that') reflects real-life speech, contributing to perceived fluency.

Overall, the answer demonstrates good use of vocabulary, varied sentence patterns, and natural delivery, aligning with strategies for achieving IH or AL scores.
