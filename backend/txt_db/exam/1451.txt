Question 
The actual OPIc question related to vacations was not asked in the provided text. The instructor was preparing to ask a random vacation question but the text ended before it was posed.

Answer 
The student's answer to the OPIc question is not available in the provided text. However, the student responded to the instructor's initial greeting 'How are you?' first with 'Fine, thank you. And you?' and then, after being prompted, with 'Pretty good yourself.'

Feedback 
The instructor provided specific feedback on how to answer 'How are you?' He strongly advised against using the phrase 'Fine, thank you. And you?' calling it unnatural ('너무 어색'). He recommended 'Pretty good yourself' as a much more natural and native-like alternative ('와우! 완전 원어민 right here'). He even demonstrated his point by briefly hanging up when the student used the 'Fine, thank you. And you?' phrase.
