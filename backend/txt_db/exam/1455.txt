Answer

Feedback 
This answer is not bad, but it lacks phrases that significantly boost the score. This is because it primarily uses simple, short sentences. Also, sentences often start with 'I', making the narrative subjective rather than objective, which makes it difficult to get a high score. To improve, use complex sentences, vary sentence beginnings (e.g., with prepositional phrases or gerunds), and incorporate more descriptive or idiomatic expressions.
