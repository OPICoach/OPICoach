Question 
Tell me about a concert you have been to recently. Who is the artist? Where was it held? Who did you go with? Why is it so memorable? Please tell me about it in detail.

Answer 
Start naturally, avoiding memorized phrases (e.g., I've been to many concerts and most of them were amazing, So I think it's hard to pick just one, Well, let me think about the most memorable one). Mention going with someone (I remember going to a concert with my college sweetheart). Mention the artist's name (It was a concert by a Korean singer called John Kim). Mention having been to their concerts multiple times (You know, I've been to more than five of his concerts since then). Describe the concert location (The concert was held at a large stadium and it was crowded with so many people). Describe the performance and stage effects (His performance were amazing and the stage effects were spectacular. You know what? His concert was packed with amazing songs and dazzling performances). Express feelings (all of them were amazing/splendid, I was so amazed the whole time). Concluding sentence (I think it was one of the best concerts I've ever been to).

Feedback 
Vocabulary: amazing (놀라운), splendid (훌륭한), dazzling (눈부신, 화려한), spectacular (장관인), packed with (가득 찬), impressed (감명받은), memorable (기억에 남는), pick one (하나를 고르다), college sweetheart (대학 시절 연인), high school sweetheart (고등학교 시절 연인), stadium (경기장), crowded (붐비는), performance (공연), stage effects (무대 효과), you know what (그거 알아요?). Grammar: Use present perfect (I've been to) to talk about past experiences. Use 'remember + ing' (I remember going) to talk about past memories. Use the structure 'It was one of the best [plural noun] I've ever been to/seen' for superlatives. Use past tense for describing the specific event. Strategy: Avoid starting with memorized phrases like 'The most memorable concert I've been to is...'. Use fillers (oh, you know, you know what) to sound natural and connect ideas. Vary vocabulary (e.g., amazing, splendid, dazzling, spectacular, impressed) to show a wider range of expression. Use superlatives (one of the best) to emphasize. Focus on describing the experience and your feelings in detail.
