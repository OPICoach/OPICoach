Question 
You indicated in the survey that you prefer to stay at home during your vacations. How do you spend your vacations at home? Describe the activities you like to do when you spend your vacation at home.

Answer 
Well, I have to say this is a good question because I love to stay home during vacations. Actually, I don't really do anything too active during vacations. This is because honestly, I get tired from work and I generally prefer to just stay home and rest. So I would say I'm kind of a homebody these days. And you know because of the COVID-19 pandemic, It's definitely a better idea to spend quality time at home.

Feedback 
The lecture emphasizes understanding the question by listening carefully, as it's not displayed during the test. It suggests linking the main topic (vacation at home) with related survey/돌발 topics like free time, holidays, gatherings, place of residence, music, and movies to build a richer narrative. A structured answer (Introduction, Body 1 for solo activities, Body 2 for activities with others, Conclusion) is recommended for coherence, which is crucial for higher scores (AL). The provided answer focuses on the introduction, offering various phrases and sentences. Feedback includes using fillers (Well, Actually, honestly, you know, So I would say) for natural speech, explaining phrases like 'anything too active,' 'prefer to' (similar to like to, but stronger preference), 'kind of' (meaning 'somewhat'), 'COVID-19 pandemic' (full term), 'definitely' (adverb for emphasis, good for AL), and 'spend quality time' (higher-level alternative to 'good time'). It's noted that the script is a guide; natural delivery is key to achieving the target score.
