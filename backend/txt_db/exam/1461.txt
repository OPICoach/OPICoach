Question 
Please tell me about the hair salon or barber shop you often go to. Are there any special things about the hair salon? How often do you visit the place?

Answer 
Well, let me think about what I can tell you about my hair salon. You know, there is a hair salon called [미용실 이름] in my town. This place has been pretty popular among the locals here. Because they're famous for creating stylish haircuts that customers want. Plus, their hair stylist skills are excellent. If you look at the online reviews, there's so many five star reviews. Also, I think another thing that makes their regular customers so satisfied is their prices. I mean, you can get a haircut or a perm at a pretty affordable price. Plus, they have a pretty low key interior. But you know, I like that part. I'm pretty friendly with the staff there, and especially with my hair stylist. We always chat about this and that while I'm getting my hair done. So, um, well, yeah, I love having such a great place in my neighborhood.
