Question 
Do you have any particularly memorable experiences at the hair salon? Or have you had any uncomfortable experiences or issues while getting your hair done at the salon?

Answer 
Well, I haven't had any really bad experiences. So, um, actually, the other day, I got a perm to switch things up, and I love the style. Oh, um, I just remembered something. And I don't think I'm the only one who's been through this. So I went to the hair salon to get my hair trimmed. I just wanted a little touch up. I was a bit nervous because my regular stylist was on vacation. So I had to go to a different one. Anyway, the stylist cut my hair way shorter than I wanted. I was so upset. But she apologized and tried to style it as best as she could. Also, I have another experience to share with you. You know, I got a perm. Um, it didn't turn out quite right. Or, it wasn't curly enough. So, I was a bit disappointed. But my stylist fixed it with another perm. You know, um, these experiences feels like the not so great ones I've had at the salon.

경험 질문: 과거 시제 사용이 필수입니다. 나쁜 경험이 없다면 'I haven't had any really bad experiences.' 처럼 시작할 수 있습니다. 스토리텔링: 미용실에서 있었던 구체적인 경험을 이야기하세요. (머리를 너무 짧게 자른 경험, 파마가 잘 안 나온 경험 등) 어휘/표현: 'the other day' (며칠 전 - a few days ago보다 자연스러움), 'get my hair trimmed' (머리를 다듬다), 'a little touch up' (약간의 손질), 'was on vacation' (휴가 중이었다), 'cut my hair way shorter than I wanted' (원했던 것보다 훨씬 짧게 잘랐다), 'I was so upset' (매우 속상했다), 'apologized' (사과했다), 'tried to style it as best as she could' (할 수 있는 한 최선을 다해 스타일링 해 주었다 - 과거 시제 'could' 사용 유의), 'got a perm' (파마를 했다), 'it didn't turn out quite right' (잘 나오지 않았다), 'it wasn't curly enough' (충분히 꼬불거리지 않았다), 'disappointed' (실망한), 'fixed it' (고쳐주었다), 'not so great ones' (그다지 좋지 않은 경험들) 등의 표현을 익히세요. 'Oh, I just remembered something.' 처럼 즉흥적으로 떠오른 듯한 연기가 자연스러움을 더합니다. 모든 경험 질문에 완벽하게 답변할 필요는 없지만, 과거 경험에 대해 유창하게 이야기할 수 있음을 보여주는 것이 중요합니다.
