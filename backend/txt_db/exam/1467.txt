Answer 
(Implicit: Using occasional English swear words)

Feedback 
Using occasional English swear words can make your answer sound natural and interesting ('깡패 모습'). Do not use direct translations of Korean swear words. Examples include mild expletives like 'damn' (preferable to 'god damn') or referring to annoying things like bugs ('B' for 벌). Don't overuse them (not 'F this, F that'). Using one sparingly can be effective and has been observed in students who received high scores. It can also be part of the '핑계 전략' when you blank out (e.g., reacting to a bug).
