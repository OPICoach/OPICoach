Question 
General Tip: Direct Quotation for IM Level

Answer 
(Implicit: Using direct quotation with 'I was like')

Feedback 
IM level students should focus on mastering Direct Quotation. Use phrases like 'I was like' followed immediately by the quote (e.g., 'I was like how much is this?'). The 'like' should be said very quickly, almost blending in. Ensure the grammar inside the quotation is correct (usually present tense). If this is difficult, start with short direct quotes like 'He was like wow.' Avoid pausing after 'I was like' as it sounds unnatural.
