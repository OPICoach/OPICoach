Question 
General Tip: Indirect Quotation for IH Level

Answer 
(Implicit: Using indirect quotation)

Feedback 
IH level students should focus on mastering Indirect Quotation. Unlike direct quotation, avoid using 'I was like'. Instead, use reporting verbs (e.g., 'asked', 'said', 'told'). Remember to apply tense shift, changing the tense of the reported speech to the past tense (e.g., 'I asked how much it was' instead of 'I was like how much is this?'). Indirect quotation sounds more natural and is expected at higher levels.
