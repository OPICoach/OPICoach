Question 
Is there a particular restaurant you often go to? What kind of food does it serve? Why do you like to go there?

Answer 
You know, as a true foodie, I can think of like so many excellent restaurants in Korea. But of those, I got to say hackers, a traditional Korean restaurant is my most go to spot these days. Well, what I like most about this place is that, um, it's super close to my place. You know, um, it's about a five minute walk away. Oh, plus another appealing point is their service. Well, all the staff there are friendly and heartwarming, which makes me feel very good. Oh, by the way. Um, what are you doing this Saturday? Well, why don't we have dinner there?

Feedback 
The question asks about a restaurant you often go to, the food it serves, and why you like it. The answer structure follows MBC (Main Idea, Body, Conclusion). Main Idea: Start with a filler like 'You know' and an expression like 'as a true foodie' (person who loves food). Use 'I can think of' (can be paraphrased as 'I can come up with', 'You can easily find') to say many restaurants come to mind. Then, choose one using 'But of those, I got to say' (can be paraphrased as 'I think', 'I would say', 'I'd say'). Clearly state the name (Hackers) and type (a traditional Korean restaurant). Use 'my most go to spot these days' (go to means frequent, can be paraphrased as 'my fave', 'my top pick', 'I love... the most', 'What I like most is...'). Body: Give reasons. Use the pattern 'What I like most about this place is that...' (can be paraphrased as 'The best thing about...', 'The best part about...', 'One cool thing about...'). Reason 1: Proximity. Say it's 'super close to my place' (place means home). Explain specifically, e.g., 'It's about a five minute walk away' (alternative: 'It takes about five minutes'). Reason 2: Staff. Use a transition like 'plus another appealing point is'. Talk about 'their service' or 'all the staff there'. Describe them as 'friendly and heartwarming'. Add the effect: 'which makes me feel very good'. Conclusion: Suggest going together or ask a reciprocal question. Use a transition like 'Oh, by the way'. Ask about their plans: 'What are you doing this Saturday?' (can be paraphrased as 'What are you up to this Saturday?'). Suggest going: 'Why don't we have dinner there?' (Why don't we pronunciation: 'Why don't we?'). 'have dinner' can be paraphrased as 'grab dinner'.
