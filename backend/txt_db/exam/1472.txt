General Feedback on OPIc Scoring and Preparation

Answer 
N/A (General advice, not a specific answer)

Feedback 
OPIc has clear scoring criteria. Repeatedly taking the test without understanding criteria is ineffective. Key criteria include vocabulary (especially adjectives and adverbs like LY adverbs), connectors/conjunctions for sentence flow, fillers (you know, I mean, you know what, oh well) for naturalness, fancy expressions (for AL), appropriate tenses (past tense crucial for IH, diverse tenses for AL), natural tone, avoiding textbook language, clear pronunciation, stress, and intonation for delivery. Avoid sounding memorized, as this is heavily penalized. Recording and reviewing your own answers is vital for checking delivery and clarity. Study partners or teachers can provide valuable feedback.
