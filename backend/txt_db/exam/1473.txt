Question 
Description/Explanation Type Questions (e.g., Describe the recycling system, your friend, a park, fashion style)

Answer 
Strategy: Do not memorize word-for-word answers. Use an outline or keywords as a guide. Practice delivering the answer naturally.

Feedback 
Focus on natural delivery using fillers (um, you know, what else, or something, and so on) and connectors (besides, what's more, on top of that). Aim for around 4-5 sentences for IH. Use descriptive vocabulary (adjectives, adverbs). Grammar is lenient if it doesn't impede understanding, but tenses should be correct. Ensure clear pronunciation and stress for good delivery.
