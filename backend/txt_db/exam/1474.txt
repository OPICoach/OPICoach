Question 
Past Experience Type Questions (e.g., Memorable experience recycling, with a friend, at a park, shopping, problems with phone/tech/home, trips, hiking, housework, losing items)

Answer 
Strategy: Memorize versatile templates for common experiences (e.g., purchasing something, something breaking, dining out, getting sick, losing something, weather-related incident). Aim for about 6 core templates.

Feedback 
Templates must be thoroughly memorized but delivered *naturally* using fillers to avoid sounding memorized. Past tense usage is essential and strictly graded (required for IH). Ensure templates incorporate high-scoring vocabulary (adjectives, adverbs, fancy expressions for AL). These templates can cover most experience questions.
