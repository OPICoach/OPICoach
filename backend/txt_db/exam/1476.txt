Question 
Comparison Type Questions (e.g., Gatherings in small towns vs big cities, geography comparison, past vs present fashion, generational differences in problem-solving/internet use)

Answer 
Strategy: IH: Provide simple answers (3-4 sentences). It's okay to state similarities rather than just differences. AL: Prepare for common comparison themes (past vs present, generation vs generation) and provide more detailed answers.

Feedback 
Comparison does not necessarily require contrast; stating similarities is acceptable. For IH, avoid getting overly detailed to prevent mistakes. AL needs to prepare thoroughly for comparison questions and use sophisticated language.
