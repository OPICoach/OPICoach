Question 
Social Issue Type Questions (e.g., Social/geographical issues in your country/similar countries, issues discussed with friends)

Answer 
Strategy: AL: Prepare versatile templates for common social issues (e.g., a template about COVID adaptable to various contexts). IH: If the question is too difficult, it's acceptable to politely pass, but know the phrases to do so.

Feedback 
Social issues are often the last question (Q15) and are critical for AL. AL must prepare versatile templates that can be adapted to different issues. IH can often pass on this question without significant penalty if other answers are strong.
