Feedback 
Deliver this outline naturally using fillers (um, you know, or something, and so on) and connectors (besides, what's more). Example phrases: 'There are very strict rules in Korea when it comes to recycling. You know it's even required by law. So what I'm trying to say is if you don't recycle things right, you can get fined or something. And also, what's more, there are a lot of recyclable items, like paper, um, glass, styrofoam, and so on. So I think we have a great system for recycling. That's all.' This approach is sufficient for IH.
