Question 
Example: How are gatherings different in small towns and big cities?

Answer 
Strategy: State that they are not very different. Mention common activities like meeting family for holidays or friends for birthdays. Speculate mildly, e.g., maybe small town people meet more in local restaurants.

Feedback 
Comparison doesn't require contrast. A simple answer stating similarity is valid. Avoid trying to find complex differences if unsure, as this can lead to mistakes. This simple approach is fine for IH.
