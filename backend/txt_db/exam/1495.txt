Question 
I'm sorry, but there is a problem that you need to resolve. A couple is coming to your house for dinner, but one of your family members is sick. Leave a message for the couple that the dinner is canceled and talk about when you will have dinner with the couple in the near future.

Answer 
Hey, I'm really sorry, but I don't think I can make it to our dinner plan because my mom isn't feeling well. Can we reschedule for another time? (Optional: Oh, you have other plans. Okay, so that's totally fine.) How about going to a restaurant for dinner tonight instead? Well, anyway, I'm so sorry again. It's my bad.

Feedback 
Need to sound sorry (act out). "make it" means keep an appointment or attend. "to [appointment/event]" can follow "make it". "isn't feeling well / not feeling good" means "몸이 안 좋아" (not feeling well), a softer way than "sick". "reschedule" means change the date/time. "for another time" is a phrase for rescheduling. Optional additions for reschedule: "maybe next week", "when she gets better", "when you're free". Optional reaction: "Oh, you have other plans. Okay, so that's totally fine. I got it." "How about ing / Why don't we" are patterns for suggestions. "instead" means in place of. "It's my bad" means "내 탓이야" (it's my fault). Keep answer concise (around 1 minute).
