Question 
You have purchased concert tickets for yourself and a friend. But unfortunately, you're unable to attend due to illness. Call your friend to explain the situation and suggest two or three alternatives to solve the problem.

Answer 
Hey, I'm really sorry, but I don't think I can make it to our concert plan because I'm not really feeling well. Can we reschedule for another time? (Optional: Oh, you have other plans. Okay, so that's totally fine.) How about going with your boyfriend/girlfriend instead? Well, anyway, I'm so sorry again. It's my bad.

Feedback 
The same template structure applies. Adapt the event name ("our concert plan"). Adapt the reason ("I'm not really feeling well" or "I'm really sick"). Adapt alternative suggestions (e.g., "going with your boyfriend/girlfriend instead"). Emphasis on acting sorry, especially when calling a friend. Keep answer concise.
