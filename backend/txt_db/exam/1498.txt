Question 
What do you like to do at the park? Tell me about your typical day at the park like from beginning to end.

Answer 
Okay, it's a pretty good question. Because I love going to the park. Well, actually, I go to the park on a regular basis. I can say maybe like two or three times a week. Yeah, going to the park is one of my favorite things to do in my free time. So, let me tell you about what I like to do at the park. Basically, I like to get some exercise at the park. You know, getting fresh air and working out at the same time makes me feel so healthy and energetic. Personally, I like to jog at the park in the morning. Yeah, I definitely enjoy morning workout especially jogging and stretching. Sometimes I just walk along the trail for like an hour which is a perfect way to refresh myself. Oh, you know what? I should also mention a spring outing. When it gets warm in the spring in Korea, a lot of flowers in the park begin to blossom. Um, so in April and May, I definitely go to the park filled with beautiful cherry blossom and have a picnic there under the trees. It's really fun to enjoy nature and just chill at the park. Well, speaking of which, it's spring time in Korea. So yeah, the spring is just around the corner. Maybe I should invite some of my friends or family and go to the park.

It emphasizes the importance of focusing on verb keywords for activities (e.g., go, have a picnic, enjoy, chill) and preparing answers that can be adapted to other topics (e.g., health, free time, travel, nature). The conclusion provides a natural wrap-up related to the current season.
