Question 
Tell me about one of the major industries or companies in your nation. How has this industry or company achieved such a high level of success? / Tell me about a promising industry in your country.

Answer 
I think it is an interesting question but it is kind of hard to say. I know what it is but it is kind of hard to say. When it comes to promising industries here in Korea, we have so many kinds of industries, ranging from automobile manufacturing to IT industry. Among them, generally speaking, it is often said that music related industry is booming these days. K-pop has become a truly global phenomenon due to the addictive melodies and endless attractive South Korean performers who can sing and dance in synchronized perfection. This trend has become increasingly visible to global audiences for the last decade. It is commonly seen that South Korean artists have hit the Billboard chart, such as Wonder Girls, then Psy, and so on. The bottom line is that K-pop is getting more attention from the world and I hope it goes on just like this. I wonder how developed and advanced this industry will be in the future. That's all I can think of now.

Feedback 
Avoid short, single-word answers like 'Industry? Interesting.' Use full sentences for reactions (e.g., 'That's an interesting question.'). Convert 'in your country' to 'here in Korea'. Use transition phrases (e.g., 'When it comes to...', 'Among them...', 'ranging from... to...'). Incorporate phrases like 'It is often said that...' or 'It is commonly seen that...' to introduce general observations. Use concluding phrases like 'The bottom line is that...' or 'The conclusion is that...'. Structure the answer into a coherent paragraph or sections to demonstrate flow, which is characteristic of IH level.
