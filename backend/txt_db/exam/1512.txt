Answer 
Yes, there is a library in my neighborhood. It's a relatively small branch library, but it's quite cozy and well-maintained. It has a good selection of books, both fiction and non-fiction, for adults and children. There's a quiet reading area, a small computer lab, and a children's corner with colorful mats and low shelves. They also hold occasional events like story time for kids or book club meetings. The library I often visit is the Central City Library. It's located downtown, right next to the City Hall building on Main Street. To get there from my house, I usually take the Line 3 subway from Oak Station and get off at Central Station. It's about a 15-minute subway ride, and then the library is just a 5-minute walk from the subway exit. It's a much larger library with multiple floors, extensive collections, including digital archives, study rooms, meeting spaces, and even a cafe. Libraries have changed a lot over the years. When I was a child, libraries were primarily just places to borrow books and maybe use a reference section. They were very quiet, and the focus was solely on physical books. Nowadays, libraries are more like community hubs. They offer free internet access, computer training, language classes, workshops, and digital resources like e-books and online databases. They are less rigid about silence in certain areas and provide collaborative spaces. They've really adapted to the digital age while still maintaining the core function of providing access to information and promoting literacy.

Feedback 
Excellent description of both your neighborhood library and the one you frequently visit. You provide good details about the size, atmosphere, and services of each. The directions to the Central City Library are specific and easy to follow, mentioning the subway line, stations, and walking time. Your comparison of past and present libraries is insightful, highlighting the shift from purely physical resources to digital and community-focused services. Vocabulary related to libraries and locations is used effectively. Using phrases like 'relatively small but cozy' and 'much larger with multiple floors' adds good descriptive depth. Well done.
