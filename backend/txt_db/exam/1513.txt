Answer 
My community holds several kinds of festivals throughout the year. We have a big Spring Blossom Festival when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom, usually around April. There's also a Summer Music Festival in July, featuring local bands and food trucks. In the fall, we have a Harvest Festival with farmers' markets, craft stalls, and activities for kids like pumpkin carving. And around Christmas, there's a Winter Lights Festival with decorations and carol singing. I usually go to these festivals on the weekend, often with my family, like my parents or siblings, or sometimes with friends. When I go, I love trying all the different kinds of food from the vendors â€“ that's always a highlight. I also enjoy browsing the craft stalls and looking for unique handmade items. If there's live music, I'll definitely stop and listen for a while. For the Harvest Festival, we often participate in the apple picking or corn maze activities. A memorable experience happened a couple of years ago at the Summer Music Festival. There was a small, relatively unknown band playing on one of the side stages. They were incredibly energetic and talented, playing a mix of rock and blues. The crowd was small but really into it. I ended up staying for their whole set, and their music was so captivating that I became a fan right there. It was a spontaneous discovery and a really fun, unexpected highlight of the festival.

Feedback 
Your answer provides a good variety of community festivals and details about each. You clearly explain when and with whom you attend, and describe your typical activities with sufficient detail. The memorable experience is well-narrated, explaining the context (unknown band), the event itself (energetic performance), and the outcome (becoming a fan). Vocabulary related to festivals, activities, and descriptions of experiences is strong. Phrases like 'in full bloom', 'featuring local bands', 'browsing the craft stalls', and 'incredibly energetic and talented' add richness to your descriptions. Good use of transition words like 'Also' and 'And' helps the flow.
