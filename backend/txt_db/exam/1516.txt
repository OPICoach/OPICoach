Question 
Do you encounter any sort of housing problems in your country? If so, what are some solutions for it? Please tell me about the issues with your housing over the years and whether it caused you any trouble.

Answer 
Yes, housing problems are definitely a significant issue in my country, particularly in major cities. The biggest problem is affordability. Housing prices and rent have skyrocketed in recent years, making it very difficult for young people and low-income families to find suitable housing. There's also a lack of supply, especially of affordable units. Some potential solutions being discussed or implemented include increasing the supply of public housing, introducing stricter regulations on speculative real estate investment, and providing financial assistance or subsidies to first-time homebuyers. Over the years, I haven't personally faced severe housing issues like homelessness, but I have experienced the trouble of rising rent. A few years ago, when my lease was up for renewal, the landlord significantly increased the rent, making it a difficult decision whether to stay or move. Finding a new place within my budget in a convenient location was quite stressful and time-consuming. This experience made me acutely aware of how precarious housing can be for many people, even those who are employed.

Feedback 
You clearly identify the main housing problems (affordability, lack of supply) and propose relevant solutions. You also effectively share a personal experience with rising rent, which makes the issue relatable and demonstrates how it has caused you trouble. Vocabulary related to housing and economics (affordability, skyrocketed, supply, public housing, speculative investment, subsidies, precarious) is used accurately. The structure of problem-solution-personal experience works well. Using 'acutely aware' is a good phrase to describe the impact of the experience.
