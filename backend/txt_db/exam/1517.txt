Question 
Compared to the past, how have cell phones developed? What kinds of influence does it have on people?

Answer 
Cell phones have developed dramatically compared to the past. When I was younger, cell phones were basic devices primarily used for making calls and sending simple text messages. They had monochrome screens, limited battery life, and certainly no internet access or cameras. Now, cell phones, or smartphones as we call them, are powerful mini-computers. They have high-resolution color touchscreens, access to the global internet, high-quality cameras, GPS, and thousands of applications for everything from banking and shopping to entertainment and education. The influence on people is immense. On the positive side, they provide instant access to information and communication, making it easier to stay connected with friends and family, navigate unfamiliar places, and access services on the go. They've also revolutionized industries like transportation (ride-sharing apps) and food delivery. However, there are also negative influences, such as potential for addiction, distraction from real-world interactions, privacy concerns, and the pressure of constant availability. They've fundamentally changed how we live, work, and socialize.

Feedback 
Excellent comparison between old and new cell phones, highlighting the key technological advancements. You effectively discuss both the positive and negative influences of smartphones on people's lives, providing specific examples (communication, navigation, ride-sharing, food delivery, addiction, privacy). Vocabulary related to technology and its impact is strong ('dramatically', 'monochrome screens', 'high-resolution touchscreens', 'revolutionized industries', 'potential for addiction', 'constant availability'). Your answer is well-balanced and detailed.
