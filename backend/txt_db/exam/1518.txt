Question 
Tell me about the geographical features of your country. What makes them different from other countries? Are there many mountains or beaches? Describe the geography of your country in detail. Can you tell me about the famous places or attractions in your country that people like to visit? What are the places people like to go in their free time? Have you ever been to a geographically unique area in your country? Where was it and what did the place look like? What did you see and do there? Was there anything special about that place? Give me all the details.

Answer 
My country has quite varied geographical features, but a dominant characteristic is that it's very mountainous. Around 70% of the land is covered by mountains, which is a much higher percentage compared to many other countries. We also have a long coastline with many beaches, especially on the east and west coasts. The interior is mostly mountainous, with some plains and river valleys. This mountainous terrain has historically influenced settlement patterns and transportation. Famous attractions include historical palaces and temples in cities, national parks known for hiking and scenic beauty in the mountains, and coastal cities with beautiful beaches and seafood. In their free time, people often go hiking in the nearby mountains, visit parks, relax at cafes, go shopping, or visit museums and art galleries. A geographically unique area I've visited is Jeju Island. It's a volcanic island located off the southern coast. It looks very distinct with its volcanic cones, lava tubes, and unique rock formations along the coast. When I was there, I hiked up Mount Hallasan, which is a dormant volcano and the highest point in the country. I also explored the Manjanggul Lava Tube, which is a massive cave formed by cooling lava. What was special about Jeju was its unique geological origin and its distinct culture, different from the mainland. The landscape felt very dramatic and unlike anywhere else in the country, with black sand beaches and basalt rock walls everywhere.

Feedback 
Your description of your country's geography is detailed and highlights the key features, especially the mountainous terrain and coastline. You effectively compare it to other countries by mentioning the high percentage of mountains. You list a good variety of famous attractions and free-time activities. The description of your visit to Jeju Island is excellent â€“ you clearly state where it is, what it looks like (volcanic features), what you did (hiked, explored lava tube), and what made it special (geological origin, distinct culture, dramatic landscape). Vocabulary related to geography and travel is rich and accurate ('varied geographical features', 'dominant characteristic', 'mountainous terrain', 'settlement patterns', 'volcanic cones', 'lava tubes', 'basalt rock walls'). This is a very strong and detailed answer.
