Okay, it's not raining cats and dogs, that could be a little bit awkward there, right? Uh, you could you could just say that it's just drizzling, okay? You know, light rain. Alright, so this is how you say light rain, drizzling, okay, right here. Drizzling, okay? ... Raining cats and dogs, that's right, 피넛, raining cats and dogs, it simply means, raining cats and dogs, it simply means heavy rain. Alright? And so, some people like to use it. Uh, it's kind of like, in my opinion, it's kind of like grandfather English these days, okay? But this is just my opinion. But you know, English is all about context, you know what I'm talking about, but I like to use, you know, it's pouring, alright? Equals heavy rain. I love that, it's pouring or it's it's raining bullets, you know what I'm talking about. I love that kind of thing, okay?
