Question 
How do people get their meals during weekdays? Do they go out to eat or have food delivered? What do busy people usually do for their meals? What do you usually do for dinner during the work week? How do you prepare dinner? Do you go to restaurants? Do you make your own meals at home? Does someone else cook for you? Do you eat alone or eat with other people? Tell me everything in detail.

Answer 
During weekdays, how people get their meals really varies depending on their lifestyle and work. Many office workers eat out at nearby restaurants or cafeterias for lunch. Food delivery services have become incredibly popular, so a lot of people also order food to their office or home. Busy people, especially, rely heavily on delivery or quick take-out options. Some people also pack lunches from home to save money or eat healthier. For dinner during the work week, my routine is usually to cook at home. I try to make my own meals most nights because it's healthier and more cost-effective than eating out or ordering delivery every day. I usually plan my meals a few days in advance and do grocery shopping on the weekend. After work, I'll spend about 30 minutes to an hour preparing dinner. Sometimes I cook just for myself, and other nights I cook for my family, and we eat together. I rarely go to restaurants for dinner on a weekday unless it's a special occasion or I'm meeting friends after work. Occasionally, if I'm really tired or short on time, I might order delivery, but cooking at home is my usual practice.

Feedback 
You provide a good overview of how people generally get weekday meals, covering various options like eating out, delivery, and packed lunches, and specifically mentioning busy people's habits. Your description of your personal dinner routine is detailed, explaining how you prepare meals, why you prefer cooking at home, and who you eat with. You also mention when you might deviate from this routine (restaurants, delivery). Vocabulary related to food and daily routines is appropriate. Phrases like 'incredibly popular', 'rely heavily on', and 'cost-effective' are well-used. The answer flows logically from general habits to your specific routine.
