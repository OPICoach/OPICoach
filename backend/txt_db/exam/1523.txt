Question 
Technology is advancing more rapidly than ever. Describe the way technology has been changing. What changes have occurred since you were a child?

Answer 
Technology is indeed advancing at an incredible speed. The way it's changing is characterized by increasing miniaturization, greater processing power, pervasive connectivity, and the integration of artificial intelligence into everyday devices. Things are becoming smaller, faster, and smarter, and almost everything is connected to the internet. Since I was a child, the changes have been revolutionary. When I was a kid, the internet was just becoming mainstream, and it was slow dial-up. Computers were bulky desktop machines. Mobile phones were rare and very basic. Information was primarily accessed through books, newspapers, or television. Fast forward to today, and we have powerful smartphones in our pockets that are more capable than the computers of my childhood. The internet is high-speed and always on. We have smart homes, wearable technology, and AI assistants. Communication is instant and global. The sheer volume of information available at our fingertips is staggering. Technology has moved from being a specialized tool to an integral and ubiquitous part of daily life.

Feedback 
You effectively describe the general trends in technological advancement (miniaturization, processing power, connectivity, AI). Your comparison between technology in your childhood and now is very clear and highlights the revolutionary changes across various areas (internet speed, computers, mobile phones, information access, smart devices). Vocabulary related to technology and change ('advancing at an incredible speed', 'miniaturization', 'pervasive connectivity', 'integration of artificial intelligence', 'revolutionary', 'bulky desktop machines', 'ubiquitous') is strong. The answer provides a good overview and specific examples of the changes.
