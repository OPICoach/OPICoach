Question 
Many restaurants today have been changing their menus to suit customers who care about health. Have you noticed this trend in your country? Describe the changes you noticed about a restaurant in your country related to this trend.

Answer 
Yes, I have definitely noticed this trend in my country. Restaurants are increasingly catering to health-conscious customers. You see it in various ways, like adding more vegetarian and vegan options, offering gluten-free alternatives, providing nutritional information or calorie counts on menus, and using healthier cooking methods like grilling or steaming instead of frying. They are also incorporating more fresh vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. As an example, there's a popular casual dining chain that I used to visit occasionally. In the past, their menu was mostly focused on comfort food, like burgers, fries, and pasta dishes with creamy sauces. Over the last couple of years, they've introduced a whole new section on their menu called 'Healthy Choices'. This section includes things like grilled chicken salads with light vinaigrettes, quinoa bowls with roasted vegetables, and lean fish dishes. They also started offering whole wheat buns for their burgers and sugar-free drink options. This shows a clear effort to attract customers looking for healthier meals while still keeping their traditional offerings.

Feedback 
You clearly identify the trend of restaurants catering to health-conscious customers in your country and provide several specific examples of how this is happening (vegetarian/vegan options, gluten-free, nutritional info, cooking methods, ingredients). You then effectively illustrate this trend by describing the changes you observed in a specific casual dining chain, contrasting its past menu with the new 'Healthy Choices' section. Vocabulary related to food, health, and restaurants ('catering to', 'health-conscious', 'vegetarian and vegan options', 'gluten-free alternatives', 'nutritional information', 'grilling or steaming', 'whole grains', 'lean proteins', 'casual dining chain', 'comfort food', 'creamy sauces', 'light vinaigrettes', 'quinoa bowls', 'roasted vegetables', 'whole wheat buns') is excellent and detailed. This is a very strong response.
