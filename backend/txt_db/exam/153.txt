Question 
Where do you live? What does your place look like? How many rooms do you have? Describe your place in detail.

Answer 
I live three bedroom apartment with my wife. You know, among them, my favorite is my own bedroom. How I can wind it down and relax in my bedroom. You know, I can do everything in my bedroom. I can listen to music and watching movie and and so on. Oh, it's a perfect place in my house. When I concentrate is something, my room is the best place in my house. You know, overall. I love my own bedroom so much.

Feedback 
The student answers the question by focusing on their bedroom as their favorite place. The instructor notes minor grammatical errors (e.g., needs 'in a' before 'three bedroom apartment', 'watch movies' instead of 'watching movie', 'Whenever I need to concentrate on something' instead of 'When I concentrate is something'). However, the instructor emphasizes the student's effective use of fillers ('You know', 'Oh') to sound natural and avoid silence. The key strength highlighted is the student's focus on one point (the bedroom) and expressing feelings about it using vocabulary like 'wind down and relax' and feeling words like 'favorite', 'perfect', and 'love'. This strategy of giving depth and feeling to a single point ('Lamborghini answer') is praised over listing multiple superficial points ('Kia Mornings'). The inclusion of a conclusion ('Overall') is also noted as good practice. The instructor advises elongating feeling words during practice to enhance expression and confirms that this approach helped the student achieve IH.
