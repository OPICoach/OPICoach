Question 
Tell me about your habits related to transportation.

Answer 
No matter what, whenever I need to go somewhere, I always take the subway or bus. This is crucial. It's quite rare for me to take other options. I love how I can read something while taking the public transit. It's the only time I can actually read. It's interesting 'cause I've never liked reading before. I still don't, but I love how it helps me to kill time, especially when I'm commuting.

Feedback 
This answer follows a 6-sentence strategy for habit questions. Sentence 1 starts with 'no matter what, whenever I... I always...' and focuses on one or two main modes of transport (subway or bus) for clarity. Sentence 2 immediately explains the feeling/importance using 'this is crucial' and the concept of it being 'rare' to do otherwise. Sentences 3 and 4 are 'freestyle' to add a unique story, using 'I love how' to explain the benefit (reading) and confirming it's the 'only time' using 'actually'. Sentences 5 and 6 use a 'quick comparison' strategy, starting with 'it's interesting 'cause' to transition to the past ('never liked reading before') and then using 'still' to return to the present, explaining the current benefit ('helps me to kill time'). This structure is a guideline that can help achieve a good score (like IH) even with a relatively short answer, though adding a conclusion is recommended for the highest scores.
