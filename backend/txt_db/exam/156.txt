Question 
Tell me about your recycling habits.

Answer 
Every time I need to recycle, I always check to see that the cans and the bottles are crushed to save space. This is very important. It's really rare for me to forget to check. I'm quite lazy, so I hate having to recycle if I don't have to. I take out the recycling only when my bins are full to the max. It's interesting 'cause I had to recycle nearly every day before. But now, with my new method of crushing everything, I recycle every two weeks.

This answer also uses the 6-sentence habit strategy. Sentence 1 starts with 'Every time I... I always check to see that...' as an alternative opening. It focuses on a simple, specific action (crushing cans/bottles) rather than listing all separation steps. Sentence 2 uses 'This is very important' (another alternative for expressing importance) and 'really rare' to emphasize consistency. Sentences 3 and 4 freestyle, explaining the reason for the habit (laziness) and the condition for taking out recycling ('full to the max'). Sentences 5 and 6 employ the 'quick comparison' strategy again, using 'it's interesting 'cause... before' to talk about the past frequency and 'But now' to describe the present frequency with the new method. This shows how the strategy can be applied to different topics, simplifying complex ones.
