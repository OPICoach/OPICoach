Question 
Tell me about your habits related to making appointments.

Answer 
I'll tell you what, I always make a hair appointment pretty much every month. I find this very important. It's very rare for me to skip a haircut. Of course, I make other appointments as well in my life, but this one is the most important to me. My hair has a mind of its own, so I need it to be well maintained. It's interesting 'cause I never cared about my hair before. But these days, I feel my hair gives me confidence.

Feedback 
This answer demonstrates the 6-sentence strategy for a potentially difficult topic like appointments. Sentence 1 starts with 'I'll tell you what' as another opening option for habit questions, specifying a regular appointment (hair). Sentence 2 uses 'I find this very important' (another alternative for importance) and 'very rare' to highlight its priority. Sentences 3 and 4 freestyle, acknowledging other appointments but emphasizing the importance of the hair appointment and explaining the reason using the expression 'My hair has a mind of its own' (or a simpler phrase if needed). Sentences 5 and 6 use the 'quick comparison' strategy, starting with 'It's interesting 'cause... before' to discuss past indifference and 'But these days' to return to the present feeling (confidence). This shows the flexibility of the strategy across various habit-based questions.
