Question 
You indicated in the background survey that you like reading. Tell me about how you first became interested in reading. How old were you, and which book has affected you the most?

Answer 
My interest in reading began when I was very young, maybe around 6 or 7. My parents used to read to me every night before bed, and I think that's where my love for stories started. The book that affected me the most is probably 'The Little Prince'. It's a simple story on the surface, but it has so many deep messages about life, friendship, and love. I read it when I was a teenager, and it really made me think about what's important in life.

Feedback 
This is a very good answer. You directly address all parts of the question with clear and natural language. Phrases like 'My interest in reading began' and 'used to read to me' are well-used. 'where my love for stories started' is a nice way to express the origin of your interest. Using 'affected me the most' is correct. 'on the surface' is a good idiom, and 'deep messages' is appropriate vocabulary. 'made me think about what's important' clearly explains the book's impact. The sentence structure is varied and fluent.
