Question 
What kinds of books do you read now? Are they the same books you liked when you were younger? How has your taste in books developed over the years?

Answer 
Nowadays, I read a lot of different genres. I enjoy fiction, especially thrillers and historical novels, but I also read non-fiction books, like biographies and books about science or history. My taste has definitely changed. When I was younger, I mostly read fantasy and adventure stories. As I've gotten older, I've started to appreciate more complex plots and deeper themes. I still enjoy a good fantasy book sometimes, but my interests have broadened considerably.

Feedback 
Excellent response. You clearly outline your current reading habits, compare them to the past, and explain the development of your taste. 'Nowadays' is a good transition. Listing specific genres ('thrillers', 'historical novels', 'biographies') adds detail. 'My taste has definitely changed' is a clear statement. The contrast between past ('mostly read fantasy and adventure stories') and present ('appreciate more complex plots and deeper themes') is well-articulated. 'broadened considerably' is good vocabulary. The flow is smooth and easy to follow.
