Question 
How do you decide which books to read? Do you just browse through a bookstore until you find a book that looks interesting? Do you follow the recommendations of other people?

Answer 
I decide which books to read in a few ways. Sometimes I do browse bookstores or libraries, looking at covers and reading blurbs. But I rely heavily on recommendations. I get suggestions from friends, family, and online book communities. I also follow book review blogs and podcasts. If a book gets a lot of positive buzz or is by an author I already like, I'm more likely to pick it up.

Feedback 
Very good answer. You provide a comprehensive explanation of how you choose books. 'in a few ways' is a good opening phrase. 'browse bookstores or libraries' is appropriate, and 'looking at covers and reading blurbs' describes the action well. 'rely heavily on recommendations' is a clear statement. Listing various sources of recommendations is helpful detail. 'positive buzz' is a natural idiom. 'more likely to pick it up' is a good concluding phrase. The response is well-structured and fluent.
