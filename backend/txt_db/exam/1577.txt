Question 
You indicated in the background survey that you have lived in a dormitory. Where was it? What kind of facilities did it have? Why did you like living there?

Answer 
I lived in a dormitory during my first year of university. It was on campus, right next to the main library. The facilities were pretty basic but sufficient. We had shared rooms, a communal bathroom on each floor, a common room with a TV and some couches, and a small kitchen area with a microwave and fridge. I liked living there because it was very convenient for classes and the library, and it was easy to meet new people and make friends.

Feedback 
Good description of your dormitory experience. You answer all parts of the question. 'during my first year of university' provides context. 'on campus, right next to the main library' gives a clear location. Listing the facilities ('shared rooms', 'communal bathroom', 'common room', 'small kitchen area') is specific and helpful. 'pretty basic but sufficient' is a good way to describe the quality. Explaining why you liked it ('very convenient', 'easy to meet new people and make friends') covers the 'why'. The language is clear and direct.
