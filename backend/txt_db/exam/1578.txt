Question 
I'd like to know more about dormitory life. Please describe a memorable experience you had while living in a dormitory. Who did you stay with? What happened? What made the experience memorable?

Answer 
A memorable experience was during exam week. I was staying with my roommate, who was also studying intensely. One night, we were both really stressed and decided to take a break. We ended up staying up all night talking, sharing snacks, and just de-stressing together. It wasn't anything dramatic, but it was memorable because it solidified our friendship and showed me the value of having someone to support you during tough times. It made the stressful week a bit more bearable.

Feedback 
This is a nice, personal story about dormitory life. You clearly state the time ('during exam week') and who you were with ('my roommate'). Describing the activity ('staying up all night talking, sharing snacks, and just de-stressing together') is vivid. Explaining why it was memorable ('solidified our friendship', 'showed me the value of having someone to support you', 'made the stressful week a bit more bearable') fully addresses the prompt. 'studying intensely' is good vocabulary. The narrative is easy to follow and emotionally resonant.
