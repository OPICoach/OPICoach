Question 
There are factors you need to consider when choosing accommodation. What is the most important factor for you when selecting a place to stay? Provide as many details as possible in your response.

Answer 
For me, the most important factor when choosing accommodation is location. It needs to be convenient for whatever I'm doing, whether it's close to work, school, or attractions if I'm traveling. A good location saves time and money on transportation and makes daily life much easier. For example, when I chose my current apartment, being near a subway station was the absolute priority. Even if the apartment itself was slightly smaller or older, the location made it worth it.

Feedback 
Excellent answer with clear reasoning and a specific example. Stating 'location' as the most important factor is direct. Explaining *why* it's important ('convenient for whatever I'm doing', 'saves time and money on transportation', 'makes daily life much easier') provides good detail. The example of choosing your apartment based on proximity to a subway station makes the point very concrete. 'absolute priority' is strong phrasing. The sentence structure is varied and effective.
