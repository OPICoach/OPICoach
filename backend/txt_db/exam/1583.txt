Question 
You indicated that you watch sports games. What sport do you like to watch? Who is your favorite team or player? Why do you like to watch them?

Answer 
I like to watch soccer, or football as it's called in many parts of the world. My favorite team is FC Barcelona. I've been following them for many years. I like watching them because they traditionally play a very attractive, attacking style of soccer with a lot of passing and movement. They've also had some legendary players over the years. Watching them play well is just beautiful to see.

Feedback 
Good clear answer about your favorite sport and team. Stating 'soccer, or football' is helpful for clarity. Naming your favorite team and mentioning how long you've followed them adds detail. Explaining *why* you like them ('attractive, attacking style', 'a lot of passing and movement', 'legendary players') provides good reasons. 'Watching them play well is just beautiful to see' is a nice personal touch. The language is straightforward and fluent.
