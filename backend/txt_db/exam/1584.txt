Question 
Which sport is the most popular in your country? Why do you think it is popular? Has the sport always been popular or has it gained popularity recently?

Answer 
The most popular sport in my country is definitely soccer. It's popular for several reasons. It's easy to understand the basic rules, you don't need expensive equipment to play casually, and there's a strong national league and national team that people feel connected to. It has always been popular, but its popularity has grown even more in recent decades, especially with the success of the national team in international competitions and the increased media coverage.

Feedback

Addressing the history of its popularity ('always been popular', 'grown even more in recent decades') shows good understanding.
