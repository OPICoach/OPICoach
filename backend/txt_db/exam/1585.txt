Question 
The provided text is an interview discussing OPIc study strategies and experiences, not a transcript of an OPIc test with specific questions and answers. Therefore, I cannot extract OPIc questions from this text.

Answer 
The provided text contains a student's explanation of how they prepared for the OPIc test and strategies they used during the test (e.g., handling unexpected topics, using filler phrases, concluding answers). It does not contain a direct answer to a specific OPIc question.

Feedback 
The provided text discusses general tips and perceived reasons for achieving a high score (AL), such as handling unexpected topics by changing the subject slightly but staying relevant, using filler phrases to buy time, and using concluding sentences. It does not provide specific feedback on the student's language use (grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation) in a particular answer.
