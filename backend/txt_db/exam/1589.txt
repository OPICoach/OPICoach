Question 
Can you tell me something interesting about your neighborhood? It can be something that happened in the past or recently. Explain what it is in detail. Tell me why it is interesting to you.

Answer 
Something interesting about my neighborhood is that it used to be mostly farmland not that many decades ago. Looking at old photos, it's hard to believe how much it has changed, from fields and scattered houses to the developed residential area it is today. It's interesting to me because it shows how quickly cities can grow and transform, and it makes me think about the history of the place where I live. It gives the neighborhood a deeper context.

Feedback 
This is an interesting piece of information about your neighborhood's history. Stating that it 'used to be mostly farmland' is a clear point. Describing the transformation ('from fields and scattered houses to the developed residential area') is effective. Explaining *why* it's interesting to you ('shows how quickly cities can grow and transform', 'makes me think about the history', 'gives the neighborhood a deeper context') fully addresses the prompt. 'not that many decades ago' is a good time reference. The language is clear and reflective.
