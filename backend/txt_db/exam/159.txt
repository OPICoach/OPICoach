Feedback 
Sam provided detailed feedback on the student's initial sentences. 'I went to Japan' was noted as a clear start. 'with my boyfriend' was good for adding detail. 'it is my first overseas trip' was corrected to the past tense 'It was my first overseas trip', emphasizing the importance of using past tense for past experiences. 'I'm very shocked' was corrected to 'I was very shocked', again stressing past tense. Sam explained the meaning of 'shocked' (충격 받았다, 놀랐다) and differentiated it from 'embarrassed' (당황스럽다, 쪽팔리다), providing synonyms like 'surprised', 'gob smacked', 'astounded', 'astonished'. 'When I arrived there, I was very surprised' was acknowledged as good use of past tense. 'Japan is similar with Korea' was noted as needing further explanation (why is it similar?). Sam then used this as an example to suggest simplifying language for beginners, like 'Our room not so good but the food awesome', and using emotional words ('amazing, unbelievable, out of this world') and direct quotations to make the answer easy for the grader to understand.
