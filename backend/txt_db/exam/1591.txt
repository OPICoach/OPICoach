Question 
Watching TV is a popular activity these days. Has a TV show ever disappointed you? What TV show was it? What happened in the show? Why didn't you like it?

Answer 
Yes, I was quite disappointed by the final season of a fantasy series I used to love. The show was called [mention a fictional show name, e.g., 'Chronicles of Eldoria']. The earlier seasons were amazing, with great characters and a compelling plot. But the final season felt rushed, the plotlines didn't make sense, and the ending felt completely unsatisfying and inconsistent with the rest of the story. It felt like the writers didn't know how to finish it properly, and it ruined my overall impression of the show.

Feedback 
This is a good example of a disappointing TV show experience. Stating you were 'quite disappointed' is clear. Mentioning it was the 'final season' and comparing it to 'earlier seasons' provides context. Describing the issues ('felt rushed', 'plotlines didn't make sense', 'ending felt completely unsatisfying and inconsistent') gives specific reasons for your disappointment. 'felt like the writers didn't know how to finish it properly' is a strong opinion. 'ruined my overall impression' is a clear statement of the impact. The language is expressive.
