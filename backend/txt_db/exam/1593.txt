Question 
Your trip overseas was canceled at the last minute, so you have to cancel the rental agreement. Explain the situation to the tenant and offer two or three alternatives to the problem.

Answer 
Hi [Tenant's Name], I'm so sorry, but I have some really bad news about the rental agreement. My trip overseas, the reason I was renting out the house, has been canceled at the very last minute. Because of this, I won't be going away anymore, and I won't be able to rent the house out to you. I know this is incredibly inconvenient, and I apologize sincerely. Perhaps I could help you find another place? Or maybe I could connect you with a friend who is also looking for a tenant right now? Another option might be if you're looking for something short-term, maybe I could still rent it for a shorter period if that works for you?

Feedback 
Your response effectively addresses the prompt by explaining the situation and offering multiple alternatives. 'I'm so sorry, but I have some really bad news...' is a good way to start when delivering bad news. 'really bad news' is a bit informal, but suitable for a direct conversation. 'My trip overseas... has been canceled at the very last minute.' This clearly explains the core problem. 'at the very last minute' is a natural idiom. 'Because of this, I won't be going away anymore, and I won't be able to rent the house out to you.' This clearly states the consequence. 'rent the house out' is correct. 'I know this is incredibly inconvenient, and I apologize sincerely.' Excellent phrasing to show empathy and formal apology. 'incredibly inconvenient' and 'apologize sincerely' are strong vocabulary choices. 'Perhaps I could help you find another place?' A good, polite suggestion. 'Perhaps' adds politeness. 'Or maybe I could connect you with a friend...' Another specific and helpful suggestion. 'connect you with' is appropriate phrasing. 'Another option might be if you're looking for something short-term, maybe I could still rent it for a shorter period if that works for you?' This provides a third alternative, showing flexibility. Using 'might be' and 'maybe' makes the suggestion tentative and polite. 'short-term' and 'shorter period' are clear. You successfully explained the cancellation and provided three distinct alternatives, fulfilling the task requirements well.
