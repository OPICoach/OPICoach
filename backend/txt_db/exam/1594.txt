Question 
What do you usually do during your vacation at home? Do you invite someone to your house, or do you plan something special for your vacation at home? Please tell me everything you do for your vacation at home.

Answer 
You know what, during my vacations at home, you know, I usually have some down time after a busy semester at college. I always relax at home. Relaxing at home is what I do at home, what I do when I have a vacation at home. This is to die for. When a bunch of homework drives me crazy during a semester, I always imagine myself lying around at home. So what I always look forward to is spending quality time with my family. We catch up on each other's lives, share stories, and just enjoy being together. So sometimes, you know, we have relatives or friends over for a little get together, like a small party. Also, enjoying my hobbies is another thing I do during my vacation at home. You know, I'm into cooking. So I try new recipes or bake cookies and bread. For me, it's a great way to unwind. It's a great stress reliever. I mean, it's a great way to unwind. So of course, you know, there are days when I simply want to laze around and binge watch my favorite TV shows or movies. It's the perfect time to cheat out and recharge for the upcoming semester. Well, another thing I do while enjoying hiking is, I might plan a day out with friends. It's always nice to catch up with friends and some fun outside of the usual college routine. Let's say I spend my vacation at this time of year. I might go to a park near my house to enjoy beautiful spring season. You know, cherry blossoms are everywhere, making this lovely spring so special. Overall, you know, having a staycation is, um, perfect for me to make the most of my time off and return to the college feeling refreshed and ready to deal with whatever comes my way.
