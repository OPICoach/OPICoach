Question 
Tell me about what you did during your last vacation at home. What did you do on each day? How did your vacation start and what did it end? Please tell me everything you did on each day in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
So my last vacation at home was pretty chill. I didn't have any big plans. Just wanted to relax and catch up with my family and friends. I don't have much to tell you about what I did on the first and second days of my last vacation at home because I just like relaxed. On the first day, I slept in. You know, I was exhausted and needed to catch up on sleep. Then I had a lazy brunch with my family and we spent the afternoon, you know, watching our favorite TV series together. I don't exactly remember, but the next day, my friends and I decided to go on a little adventure. So we went hiking in the nearby mountains, which was absolutely amazing because the weather was perfect and the views were breathtaking. We had a picnic at the top and took tons of selfies for Instagram. Also, I met up with my old high school friends. You know, we went to our favorite cafe and spent hours reminiscing about the old school days. It was so heartwarming. I also remember I had a cozy movie night with my siblings on the last day of my staycation. We ordered in pizza and watched a hilarious Korean movie. Overall, my vacation was exactly what I needed to recharge and get ready for the new semester.

Feedback 
Use past tense consistently when talking about a past event. "Pretty chill" means very relaxed or easygoing. "Slept in" means intentionally sleeping late (vs. "overslept" which is sleeping past a planned time unintentionally). "Exhausted" is similar to "worn out", meaning very tired. "Catch up on sleep" means getting needed sleep. "Catch up with" is used for meeting someone to talk and share updates (vs. "catch up on" for tasks). "Lazy brunch" implies a relaxed, unhurried meal. "TV series" is more common than "TV drama" (though "Korean drama" is specific). "Go on a little adventure" is a way to describe an outing. "Nearby mountains" keeps it relevant to a home vacation. "Absolutely amazing" and "breathtaking" are strong adjectives. "Took tons of selfies" is a casual way to say took many photos. "Met up with" is a common phrase for meeting people. "Reminiscing" means recalling past memories; you can simplify to "talking about the old school days". "Heartwarming" describes a touching or pleasant feeling. "Cozy" describes a comfortable and warm feeling or place. "Ordered in" means ordering food for delivery. "Hilarious" means very funny. "Recharge" means to regain energy. "Get ready for" means preparing for something. "Exactly what I needed" or "exactly what I wanted" is a good concluding phrase.
