Question 
Please describe your favorite weapon from a video game. What does it look like, how does it function, and why do you like it?

Answer 
My favorite weapon in game is The Last Word from Destiny 2. It's a hand cannon. It look very cool, like old west style. It has a fan-fire ability, very fast shooting. I like it because it feel powerful and sound good. Also, it is famous weapon in game lore. Many player like it too. I use it mostly in PvP, where fast kill is important. It is hard to control recoil, but rewarding when you hit headshots. I think it is iconic weapon.

Feedback 
Here is some feedback on your answer:

1.  "My favorite weapon in game is..." -> It's better to say "My favorite weapon in *the* game is..." or "My favorite weapon in *a* game is...". "The game" is usually more natural when talking about a specific game you play.
2.  "It look very cool..." -> The subject is "It" (singular), so the verb needs an 's'. It should be "It *looks* very cool...".
3.  "...like old west style." -> This phrase is a bit awkward. You could say "...like an old West style weapon" or "...with an old West style design".
4.  "It has a fan-fire ability, very fast shooting." -> This is understandable, but you could connect the ideas more smoothly. For example, "It has a fan-fire ability, *allowing for* very fast shooting." or "It has a fan-fire ability, *which allows it to shoot* very fast."
5.  "I like it because it feel powerful and sound good." -> Again, subject-verb agreement. "It" is singular, so the verbs need an 's'. "I like it because it *feels* powerful and *sounds* good."
6.  "Also, it is famous weapon in game lore." -> You need an article before "famous weapon". It should be "Also, it is *a* famous weapon in game lore."
7.  "Many player like it too." -> "Player" should be plural because you used "Many". It should be "Many player*s* like it too."
8.  "I use it mostly in PvP, where fast kill is important." -> "Kill" should be plural here, as you're talking about multiple instances of killing. "...where fast kill*s* are important." Or, "...where getting fast kill*s* is important."
9.  "It is hard to control recoil..." -> This is okay, but slightly more natural phrasing might be "Its recoil is hard to control..." or "It has hard-to-control recoil...".
10. "I think it is iconic weapon." -> You need an article before "iconic weapon". Since "iconic" starts with a vowel sound, use "an". It should be "I think it is *an* iconic weapon."

Overall, your description is clear and covers the main points. Focusing on subject-verb agreement (adding 's' to verbs with singular subjects like 'it') and using articles ('a', 'an') correctly will significantly improve your fluency and accuracy.
