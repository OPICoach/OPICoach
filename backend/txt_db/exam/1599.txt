Question 
null

Answer 
A couple of years ago, I painted the living room all white. I did it myself. Having the white walls makes it brighter. Another change is that I have the TV on the opposite wall. I put my sofa exactly where I where I want to watch TV. There are not a whole lot of changes, but just simple ones. That's about it.

Feedback 
This answer demonstrates a tendency to speak in sentence units, listing changes rather than elaborating on one or two in detail. While sentences are grammatically simple and clear, the overall structure lacks the paragraph development discussed in the lecture as characteristic of higher levels (IH/Advanced). This style is often associated with IM levels.
