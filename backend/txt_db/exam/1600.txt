Answer 
I live in apartment. There are TV, computer, table, sofa and closet in my house and my favorite room is of course my room and there are bad, desk, closet, and bookshelves and mirror in my room and on the bookshelves I put my time table on it because of my time schedule and on in the bookshelves there are so many books so I sorted those books by subject so that I can find whatever books I want to read effectively and efficiently.

Feedback 
This answer attempts to provide more detail and connect ideas, moving beyond simple listing. It shows an effort to structure thoughts into a longer response, potentially aiming for paragraph-level speaking. However, it contains grammatical errors ('I live in apartment', 'there are bad') and some awkward phrasing or repetition ('on the bookshelves... on it', 'on in the bookshelves'). While showing more content than a basic sentence-level response, these errors and structural issues can prevent it from reaching higher levels like IH, often placing it in the IM range (IM1/IM2) as discussed in the lecture regarding errors impacting the final score within the IM band.
