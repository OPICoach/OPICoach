Answer 
To talk about where I live, my house has some basic furniture such as a sofa, table, desk, bookshelves, and closets. There are several rooms in my home that I like. However, the one where I feel most comfortable and is my favorite is my reading room. The room is quite large, measuring about 5 by 6 meters, and it is printed in light blue. It has a desk, a bookshelf, and coffee table. It is the room where I keep all the books that are associated with my study. If I'm feeling stressed after a hard day at uni, there is no place that I'd rather be than home.

This answer effectively demonstrates the 'paragraph-level' speaking style emphasized in the lecture for achieving IH or Advanced scores. It introduces the topic, narrows down to a specific point (favorite room), provides descriptive details (size, color, furniture), explains its function/purpose, and concludes with a summarizing sentence about its importance. The sentences are varied in structure, and the ideas flow logically, creating a cohesive response characteristic of higher OPIc levels.
