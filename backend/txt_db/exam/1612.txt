Question 
I'd like to know about popular social media in your country. Also, tell me about social network services you often use. What's your favorite and what kind of features does it have?

Answer 
I think this is a pretty interesting question. You know Instagram and Facebook are the most popular social media platforms in Korea. I think people wanna share their life with others through social media. On these sites people post pictures of what they eat, what they do, um where they go and, you know, what they like. Also people leave comments with their postings. Plus we can also leave short comments on other people's postings. What I personally like the most about them is that I can always keep in touch with my friends and um online friends. I also look up a lot of information on these sites. Um what's more, you know, looking up a huge variety of information is another thing that attracts me. For example um I'm into cooking these days. So I often search for a huge variety of recipes on Instagram and Facebook. on top of that You can see tons of reviews of restaurants, movies, um concerts and so on. Besides both of them offer instant messaging and live streaming. people including celebrities live stream on these sites. There's one more website that is famous worldwide. You know and it's also popular in Korea. along with Facebook and Instagram. people share many kinds of video clips on YouTube. In fact I heard that YouTube is the second most used search engine. These days you know YouTube is more popular than television. um like you know like people are used to watching a huge variety of YouTube videos rather than watching TV shows. You can even watch short video clips of TV shows on YouTube. Um I personally love watching video clips on YouTube because I think they're mostly based on fresh ideas and have fun things that show like real life. You know YouTube videos are free but you know you have to watch some advertisement while watching videos. Um if you don't want to watch ads, you just need to purchase their premium membership which cost about $12 or something. Also you know on this site you can even subscribe to channels. like I personally subscribe to a music channel that streams different type of music according to a theme. like songs that help you concentrate, um best workout songs and songs for driving. so I think Facebook, Instagram and you know YouTube are the most popular social media platforms in Korea and they're my favorites.

This is a comprehensive answer covering popular platforms, personal usage, features, and examples. Key strengths include using various connecting words (Also, Plus, What's more, For example, on top of that, Besides, In fact, so) to create a coherent structure, demonstrating a wide range of vocabulary (post pictures, leave comments, keep in touch with, look up information, a huge variety of, be into, tons of, instant messaging, live streaming, subscribe to, streams), and providing specific examples (types of posts, searching recipes, reviews, YouTube content). The use of fillers (You know, um, like, or something) and adverbs (personally, mostly) adds naturalness. Varying sentence structure (e.g., using 'What I personally like the most is...') is good for higher levels. Pay attention to pronunciation of specific words (Korea, comfortable, interesting, restaurant, genre, peninsula) and intonation to avoid sounding memorized. Ensure correct preposition usage (on these sites, subscribe to). Overall, this answer demonstrates strategies suitable for aiming for IH/AL by going beyond basic facts and adding detail, examples, and varied language.
