Question 
What kind of music do you like? When and where do you usually listen to music? How do you listen to music? Provide as much detail as possible.

Answer 
I absolutely love listening to music. I can say music has always been a big part of my life. Actually, I listen to every style of music, but I've always liked pop music since I was a teenager. When it comes to music, I listen to it every morning and night. I usually listen to some pop music when I'm on the move. So, whenever I get on the bus or subway, I pop in my Bluetooth earphones and listen to my favorite pop songs. Speaking of the device I use, I mostly listen to music on my smartphone because, you know, I always have my phone on me. So I can listen to music wherever I am. And I often use the music player apps like Melon and YouTube. Also, I enjoy watching live concerts and music videos on YouTube. Well, anyway, I think music is an important part of my daily life, and I feel like music always helps me feel better. So yeah, I can't imagine my life without music.
