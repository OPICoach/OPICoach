Question 
Tell me about the most memorable experience you have had while listening to music. When was it? Where did it happen? What made the experience so memorable? Please describe it in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
Well, I guess I can tell you about the most memorable concert I went to. It was the BTS concert in 2018, which I went with my sister. I've been to several different concerts, but the BTS concert was the best one I've ever been to. The concert was held in Olympic Stadium in Seoul, Korea. The concert venue was seriously huge, and it was filled with tens of thousands of people. The concert lasted nearly three hours, but it felt much shorter because I was enjoying it so much. They sang about 25 songs, which included all of my favorite songs like DNA, Idol, Blood, Sweat, and Tears, etc. What made the BTS concert particularly memorable was how the audience reacted to the music. The energy of the people at the concert was unbelievable. Everybody in the audience, including myself and my sister, went crazy for them. My sister and I were singing and dancing so hard the entire time that we lost our voice. Looking back, it was really a splendid concert. All seven members of BTS were incredibly talented, and their performance was fabulous. You know, I'm a huge fan of BTS, so for me, this is a memory I'll always treasure. I hope to go to their concert again if there's a chance.

This answer provides a detailed narrative of a memorable experience. It clearly identifies the event (BTS concert), provides context (when, where, who with), describes the setting and duration, lists specific examples (songs), and most importantly, elaborates on *why* it was memorable (audience energy, personal reaction like 'went crazy', 'lost our voice'). The use of strong adjectives ('seriously huge', 'unbelievable', 'splendid', 'incredibly talented', 'fabulous') enhances the description. This level of detail and descriptive language is excellent for IH/AL.
