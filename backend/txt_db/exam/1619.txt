Question 
Tell me about the seasons in your country. How many seasons are there, and what is the weather like in each season? Which season do you personally like? Please explain in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
Korea has four distinct seasons, each with very different weather. For instance, summer is very hot and humid. During July and August, it rains a lot, sometimes for days on end. On the other hand, in the winter, the temperature often drops below zero, so it's super cold. At times, it snows a lot in the winter, so the roads get icy and slippery. As for the spring and fall, the temperatures are moderate and comfortable. Personally, I prefer the spring and fall because I love to take a walk and go for a bike ride, especially when it's not too cold and not too hot. You know, in the spring in Korea, the flowers bloom all over the country, so it gets very pretty. And in the fall, the leaves turn red and yellow, so I enjoy going to the beautiful mountains and take pictures of the colorful trees.

Feedback 
The answer clearly lists the four seasons and provides specific weather characteristics for each ('hot and humid', 'rains a lot', 'drops below zero', 'icy and slippery', 'moderate and comfortable'). It uses good transition phrases ('For instance', 'On the other hand', 'As for'). The speaker states their preference and provides detailed reasons, including activities they enjoy and descriptions of the scenery ('flowers bloom', 'leaves turn red and yellow'). This comprehensive description meets the requirements for detailed explanation at IH/AL.
