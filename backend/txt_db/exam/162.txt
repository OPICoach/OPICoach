Question 
what did you do yesterday?

Answer 
Yesterday, um, I just had an opportunity to meet my friend whose name is Sam. Actually, you know, he's really famous YouTube channel owner in Korea, right? And then we just um had a pretty great time, you know, we just did some um cardio exercise and weight training our gym for his body and my body as well. And then we just also had a chat for something like for our studying for English or our next concept for our video and, you know, it was pretty interesting time for me because I had so many interest about study and the weight training. So these days I I'm really happy with um having some time with this guy. So I'm really happy with that.

Feedback 
Jason's answer was evaluated using the 'enbody' system with 8 categories. For 5W and N5W (Natural 5Ws), Jason covered the key information naturally, scoring 5 points for N5W. For MP (Main Point), Jason listed multiple activities (meet friend, gym, chat) but lacked a single, developed main point with sufficient detail, scoring 0 points. For CT (Connections, Transitions), the transitions were weak, making the points feel separate, scoring 0 points. For FE (Feelings, Emotions), Jason used three emotions (great, interesting, happy) but repeated 'I'm really happy', resulting in 0 points (need three *different* emotions). For FL (Figurative Language), none was used, scoring 0 points. For FS (Fillers, Silence), Jason used fillers ('um', 'you know', 'right?'), scoring 1 point. For NFS (Natural FS), the fillers were used naturally, scoring 1 point. Areas for improvement include developing a single main point with detail, using stronger connections/transitions between ideas, using a variety of emotional expressions without repetition, and incorporating figurative language.
