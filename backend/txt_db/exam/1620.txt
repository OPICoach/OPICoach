Question 
How has the weather in your country changed over the past few years? What was the weather like in the past? How has it changed? Describe the differences in detail.

Answer 
This is a hard one which I've never really thought about. I guess there are some differences between the country's weather in the past and that of today. Honestly, I don't quite remember what the weather was like when I was a kid. But I would have to say the four seasons divided the year evenly in the past. This gave everyone a chance to experience each season to the full. These days, however, summer and winter seem to last longer than the other two seasons. So basically, summer and winter in Korea have been longer and longer. This means that for a full five months, we must endure the humidity of summer, and for the same amount of time, the harshness of winter. On the other hand, the mild weather of spring and fall passes in the blink of an eye. I'm not quite sure, but maybe it's because of global warming.

Feedback 
The answer starts naturally by acknowledging the difficulty of the question. It effectively contrasts past and present weather patterns, using phrases like 'divided the year evenly' vs. 'last longer'. The description of summer and winter lasting 'longer and longer' and spring/fall passing 'in the blink of an eye' is vivid. Attributing the change to 'global warming' adds a relevant point. The comparison is detailed and well-articulated, demonstrating higher-level thinking and vocabulary.
