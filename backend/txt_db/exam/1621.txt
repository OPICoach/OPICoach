Question 
Tell me about a memorable or unexpected incident related to the severe weather conditions. What happened, and how did you deal with the situation? What made the incident unforgettable? Tell me everything about the experience.

Answer 
One example of unusual weather that sticks out for me is the storm that occurred a few years ago. One day, a huge storm passed through my city and destroyed numerous buildings. When the storm struck my town, my apartment building shook, and it really scared me. You can't imagine how violent it was. I'd never felt something like that before. Actually, I was supposed to meet up with my friend for a walk that night, but we had to cancel our plan because of the storm. Looking back now, the incident was unforgettable because I felt so powerless in the face of a big storm. Although the government managed to repair the damage, I realized that we are still at the mercy of nature.

Feedback 
This answer provides a clear narrative of a specific weather incident. It describes the event ('huge storm'), its impact ('shook', 'scared', 'violent'), and a consequence ('had to cancel our plan'). The reflection on why it was unforgettable ('felt so powerless', 'at the mercy of nature') adds depth and personal insight. The language is descriptive and engaging, making the experience vivid for the listener. This detailed storytelling is characteristic of higher OPIc levels.
