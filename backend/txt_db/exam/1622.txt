Question 
I'm going to give you a situation to act out. Imagine that you have gone to a store to buy new furniture. Ask the salesperson three or four questions about the furniture you're looking for.

Answer 
Hi. I'm looking for a new coffee table and chairs. Could you help me out with some recommendations? Thank you. So, what are my options for a small coffee table? I live alone in a small apartment, so I'm looking for something that's not very big. Also, do you have any matching chairs with the table? I spend a lot of time sitting on the chair, so I would say the comfier the better. Lastly, do you happen to have any special promotions going on this week? Last time, I got a 10% discount for a holiday special. Well, that's awesome. Thank you so much. That was very helpful. I really appreciate it.

Feedback 
This roleplay response is excellent. It starts with a polite greeting and clearly states the purpose. The speaker asks a series of relevant questions about the furniture, including size options, matching items, comfort, and promotions, fulfilling the requirement of asking 3-4 questions. The questions are natural and appropriate for the situation. The closing remarks are also polite and appreciative, demonstrating good conversational skills.
