Question 
Please describe a healthy person you know of. What does the person do for his or her health? Please tell me everything about the things that make the person stay fit.

Answer 
I think my best friend Ellie cares about her health a lot. She tries to cook at home as often as she can because you know she thinks cooking at home is better for her health than eating out. On top of that, she tries to eat fresh meat, veggies and fruits. Even though she doesn't have enough time to work out because she is very busy doing a job, she does her best to work out at least three times a week. She said she has been working out at a gym since she was in her early 20s. She started working out to lose weight. However, you know, now she exercise to stay healthy. Also, I've never seen her eat late night meals. She also gets her medical checkups regularly. What's more, she's really outgoing and a little bit laid back. It seems like she doesn't have worries all the time. Also, she has a very positive mindset. Whenever I'm stressed out, I talk to her. Talking with her relieve stress because she is a great listener, you know. So my friend Ellie is the healthiest person I know. She does so many things to stay fit and healthy.
