Question 
What kind of music did you listen to when you were young? How was that music different from the music you enjoy now? Has your interests in music changed over the years? How has your taste in music changed?

Answer 
Oh my gosh. The music I listened to as a kid and the music I enjoy now. Wow, that's a hard one. Um, this is a hard one. Because you know, it's quite a long time ago. I don't think my taste in music has changed a lot. But I'll try my best to compare the two. When I was a kid, I wasn't so interested in music. I just listened to whatever that was on TV like K-pop. So I would listen to some Korean pop songs on music TV show. But I'll have to say I didn't really have musical taste back in the day. But now, I basically listen to many different types of music. Including K-pop, American pop, jazz, and classical music. I feel like I have varied taste in music. Well, If I had to choose one of my favorite genres, I would choose American pop music. There are so many awesome pop singers I like. Um, but my favorite ones are Beyonce, Lady Gaga, and Maroon 5. They're like all Americans. Speaking of my favorite pop songs, I prefer upbeat melodies and catchy rhythm. Overall, I absolutely love listening to music now. I can't imagine my life without music. I would say Music has become an indispensable part of my life. Because I listen to it all the time. And listening to music always helps me feel better.

Feedback 
Overall, this is a well-structured answer that directly addresses the question by comparing past and present music tastes. The use of transition words like 'But now' clearly separates the past and present. The answer incorporates various vocabulary and sentence structures, which is excellent for higher grades. Specific feedback points: 1. Introduction: Starting with 'Oh my gosh' and 'Wow, that's a hard one' adds naturalness and shows emotion. Paraphrasing 'when you were young' to 'as a kid' and 'like' to 'enjoy' is good. 'quite a long time ago' is a nice intensifier. Stating 'I don't think my taste in music has changed a lot' upfront is a good strategy to manage the comparison. 'taste in music' and 'musical taste' are appropriate terms. 'I'll try my best to compare the two' is a good closing for the intro. 2. Body 1 (Past): 'When I was a kid' and 'back in the day' are good past time markers. Using past tense verbs like 'listened to' and 'wasn't interested' is correct. 'listened to' pronunciation can be tricky, practice is key. 'whatever that was on TV' is a natural phrase. 'would listen to' is a good alternative to 'used to' for past habits. 'music TV show' is specific. The AL phrase 'But I'll have to say I didn't really have musical taste' adds sophistication and expresses opinion. 3. Body 2 (Present): 'But now' is a strong transition. 'basically' is a useful filler. Using 'many different types/kinds/genres' shows vocabulary variety. Listing genres with 'Including... etc.' is good (remember 'etc.' pronunciation). 'classical music' pronunciation is important. 'I feel like I have varied taste in music' is a great phrase (practice 'varied'). Using the conditional 'If I had to choose...' is good structure. Listing specific singers adds detail. 'Speaking of...' is a useful transition for introducing a sub-topic. 'prefer' is a good verb for stating preference. 'upbeat melodies' and 'catchy rhythm' are excellent, specific vocabulary for describing music (especially for AL). 4. Conclusion: 'Overall' is a good concluding marker. Using strong adverbs like 'absolutely' or 'definitely' is effective. 'I can't imagine my life without music' is a common, natural idiom. The AL phrase 'Music has become an indispensable part of my life' uses the present perfect ('has become') correctly and includes advanced vocabulary ('indispensable'). Explaining why ('Because I listen to it all the time') and the effect ('always helps me feel better') adds depth. Practice pronunciation of 'indispensable' and 'helps me feel better'.
