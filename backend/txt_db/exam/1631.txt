Question 
Tell me about a problem experience you had related to technology.

Answer 
Well, I don't know. I can't think of an experience like that. Seriously, I don't think I've had a problem related to technology. So if it's okay with you, can I just talk about something related? I can probably tell you about an experience I've had while using my smartphone.

Feedback 
This answer effectively uses filler words and phrases ('Well', 'Seriously') to buy time. It directly addresses the question by stating the lack of a specific experience ('I don't know', 'I can't think of an experience like that', 'I don't think I've had a problem related to technology'). It politely asks for permission to change the topic ('So if it's okay with you, can I just talk about something related?') and offers a related, potentially prepared topic ('I can probably tell you about an experience I've had while using my smartphone'). The use of 'probably' adds a natural, slightly hesitant tone. Alternatively, you could state you will skip the question directly by saying 'Since I don't have an experience related to this topic, I'll just move on to your next question'.
