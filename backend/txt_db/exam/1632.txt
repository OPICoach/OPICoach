Question 
Compare websites of the past and present. How have websites changed from the past until now?

Answer 
Oh my gosh, the differences between the websites of the past and the websites of today? Wow. I have to say that's a very complicated question. To be honest, I didn't use to surf the internet when I was a child, so I have no idea about this. Besides, I don't think there have been a lot of changes in the websites. Not really sure. So since I don't know much about the websites of the past, I'll just talk about my favorite website.

Feedback 
The answer starts with a reaction ('Oh my gosh') and repeats the question's core ('the differences between the websites of the past and the websites of today?') to show understanding and gain time. It explicitly states the difficulty ('that's a very complicated question'). It provides a reason for not knowing about the past ('To be honest, I didn't use to surf the internet when I was a child') and clearly states lack of knowledge ('so I have no idea about this'). It adds another point ('Besides') suggesting minimal change ('I don't think there have been a lot of changes'), using the present perfect 'have been'. It concludes by stating the intention to talk about a related, known topic ('So since I don't know much about the websites of the past, I'll just talk about my favorite website'). Alternatively, you could state you will skip the question directly by saying 'I'll just skip this question and move on to the next one'.
