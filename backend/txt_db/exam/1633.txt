Question 
Tell me about an issue related to recycling that you saw in the news.

Answer 
Oh, seriously? issues related to recycling? Wow. Well, this is something I've never thought about. Frankly speaking, I have no idea about this because I hardly read the news these days. On top of that, I hate to say this, but I'm not very interested in this topic. So, I can't think of any issues related to recycling in my country. Yeah, I'm sorry, but I really don't know what to say. So, I'll have to move on to the next question.

Feedback 
This response effectively uses reactions ('Oh, seriously?', 'Wow') and fillers ('Well') to show engagement despite difficulty. It states the topic is unfamiliar ('this is something I've never thought about'). It uses 'Frankly speaking' for sincerity and provides a specific reason for not knowing ('because I hardly read the news these days'). It adds another reason ('On top of that') and uses 'I hate to say this' to soften the statement about lack of interest ('I'm not very interested in this topic'). It concludes by stating the inability to recall relevant issues ('So, I can't think of any issues related to recycling in my country'). Finally, it apologizes ('I'm sorry') and clearly indicates the intention to skip ('So, I'll have to move on to the next question'), which is a valid strategy.
