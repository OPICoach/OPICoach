Question 
The provided text explains OPIc question types related to describing locations (e.g., 'Can you describe the general features of [location] in your country?' or 'Tell me about the [location] you often go to. What is it like?'). However, it does not present a specific OPIc question asked to a student.

Answer 
The provided text outlines five 'master patterns' for describing locations and demonstrates how they can be applied to six different places (bank, restaurant, hair salon, hotel, library, hospital). It also includes audio examples of these patterns being spoken. However, it does not contain a specific student's answer to an OPIc question.

Feedback

It discusses OPIc question formats and provides example sentences based on the patterns. However, it does not offer specific feedback on a student's actual answer, such as corrections on grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, or structure of a particular response. Therefore, detailed feedback on a student's sentences and words cannot be generated from this text.
