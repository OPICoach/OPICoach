Question 
Have you ever had any memorable experiences that Hair salon? What was it like? What happened? Please tell me everything in detail.

Answer 
There was a time when I asked for a layered cut, but the stylist made the layers too short, which didn't suit my face shape. I felt self-conscious about the style and disappointed with the result. I politely explained my concerns to the stylist, and they offered to adjust it slightly. Although it wasn't perfect, I appreciated their effort to fix the haircut. This experience taught me the importance of bringing reference photos to show exactly the style I want.
