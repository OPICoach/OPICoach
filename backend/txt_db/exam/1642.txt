Question 
Have you ever had any memorable experiences that Hospital? What was it like? What happened? Please tell me everything in detail.

Answer 
There was a time when I asked for a quick checkup, but it didn't meet my expectations because the doctor was rushed. I felt disappointed about the lack of communication during the consultation. I politely explained my concerns to the nurse, and they tried to arrange another appointment with a different doctor. Although it wasn't perfect, I appreciated their effort to address my concerns and provide additional guidance. This experience taught me the importance of preparing specific questions to ask during a doctor's appointment.
