Question 
Have you ever had any memorable experiences that Library? What was it like? What happened? Please tell me everything in detail.

Answer 
There was a time when I asked for assistance finding a specific book, but it didn't meet my expectations because the staff couldn't locate it. I felt frustrated about the unorganized bookshelves, which made it hard to find the materials I needed. I politely explained my concerns to the librarian, and they tried to help by checking the system and searching for alternatives. Although it wasn't perfect, I appreciated their effort to provide a list of similar books I could use instead. This experience taught me the importance of arriving early to ensure I can get the resources I need before they are taken.
