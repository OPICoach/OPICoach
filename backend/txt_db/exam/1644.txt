Question 
Have you ever had any memorable experiences that Hotel? What was it like? What happened? Please tell me everything in detail.

Answer 
There was a time when I asked for a room with a city view, but it didn't meet my expectations because the view was blocked by another building. I felt disappointed about the cleanliness of the room, as it didn't meet the standard I expected. I politely explained my concerns to the front desk staff, and they tried to resolve the issue by upgrading my room. Although it wasn't perfect, I appreciated their effort to offer complimentary services as compensation. This experience taught me the importance of double checking the room details before confirming a reservation.
