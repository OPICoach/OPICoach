Question 
You bought a product last week, but there is something wrong with it. Go to the store to explain the situation and ask for a refund or exchange.

Answer 
Yes, you can. I'd like to return these shoes. I just bought them last week but they're already falling apart. It's really a shame. They looked great when I tried them on. No, I just want a refund. Actually, I think I lost the receipt. No, I don't. So what happens now? So that means I can buy something else later on. That sounds good. Sure, no problem. Great, thanks. You've been very helpful.
