Question 
Do you ever get road rage?

Answer 
Well, luckily, I don't think I've ever got road rage. I mean, I find myself to be very lucky. And I also try to be very calm while driving, which is so important, right? Um, but of course, sometimes I want to yell at other drivers and curse them as well. Especially when they try to, you know, cut in the line or do tailgating or whatever. You know what I mean, right? I I'm also very busy with my life. So I sometimes want to get somewhere so quickly. But I've never, you know, tried to do something dangerous on the road, which is not good for other people, right? Um, so um, and even if I'm so angry at other drivers, as I told you, I try to stay calm. Wow.
