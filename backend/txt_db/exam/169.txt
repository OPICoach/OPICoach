What did you do today?

Answer 
Today I went art class in morning.

Feedback 
The start 'Today' is good as it uses a word from the question. The sentence 'Today I went art class in morning' should be 'Today I went to art class in the morning'. You need 'to' before 'art class' to indicate the destination, and 'the' before 'morning' is standard usage ('in the morning', 'in the afternoon', 'in the evening'). For seasons, you can use 'in winter' but 'during the winter' is also a good alternative. When the teacher repeated 'Did you say art class?', it was a strategy to clarify/confirm and show engagement (a follow-up question). When you said 'I liked arts', it should be 'I like art' (present tense) or 'I love art', 'I'm really into art'. Your explanation about stopping and starting again ('I stop stop it in the past' and 'I want to try to it') could be phrased more smoothly as 'I started painting a while back and then for some reason I stopped. But then I decided to start again.' 'A while back' is a good alternative for 'long time ago' or 'in the past'. 'Decided to' is a useful phrase. 'Take up' is a good alternative for 'start' when talking about hobbies, e.g., 'I decided to take up painting again'.
