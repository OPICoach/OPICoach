Question 
What is your favorite shoe brands?

Answer 
I love Fred Perry the most because their sneakers are just amazing, you know? They are so adorable, so beautiful. And I think they are out of this world, you know? Um, I'm not that kind of, um, you know, fashionable person. But, you know, whenever I, you know, wear these shoes, oh my gosh, I look so professional. So, people are keep asking me like, you know, where did you get this? But I don't want to share with this. Cuz, you know, I'm the one who wants to be looking good, you know? And in my eyes, they are just like Lamborghini, you know? If I have much money, I don't want to buy one Lamborghini, but I want to buy Fred Perry company so that I can have them all, you know? Every single day I can wear each of them. Just thinking about it makes me so happy. Oh my gosh. Yeah,

Feedback 
The student's answer effectively connects different ideas back to the main point (Fred Perry), earning the CT point. The use of the 'if' strategy to connect the idea of buying a Lamborghini to buying Fred Perry shoes is highlighted as particularly good. However, the words 'adorable' and 'beautiful' are noted as potentially sounding feminine for a male speaker, and 'attractive' and 'nice' are suggested as alternatives. The overall connection ability is praised.
