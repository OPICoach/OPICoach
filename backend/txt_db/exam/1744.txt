Question 
One that's the end of the situation. Have you ever bought a piece of technology which was not what you wanted or different from what you had expected? Was the feature not what you wanted or did it just not work properly? Tell me about a time when you bought some new technology.

Answer 
Yes, I have experience about buying technology that was not good. I bought a smart watch last year online. I was very exciting to get it. But when I received it, the battery life was very short. It said it can last for 3 days, but it only last for one day. I was very disappointed. I tried to contact the seller, but they didn't respond well. So I just keep using it, but I don't like it.

Feedback 
Your answer is a good start, telling a clear story about buying a smartwatch. Here are some points for improvement:

1.  **'experience about buying technology that was not good'**: 'experience with buying technology that was not good' or 'experience buying technology that didn't meet my expectations' sounds more natural. 'not good' is a bit vague; 'didn't work well' or 'was faulty' or 'didn't meet my expectations' are better.
2.  **'I was very exciting to get it'**: Use the '-ed' ending for how you felt. 'I was very excited to get it'.
3.  **'But when I received it, the battery life was very short'**: Good use of 'But' to show contrast. 'battery life was very short' is clear.
4.  **'It said it can last for 3 days, but it only last for one day'**: Use past tense for 'can' and 'last'. 'It said it could last for 3 days, but it only lasted for one day'.
5.  **'I tried to contact the seller, but they didn't respond well'**: 'didn't respond well' is okay, but 'didn't respond quickly', 'were not helpful', or 'didn't offer a solution' could be more specific.
6.  **'So I just keep using it, but I don't like it'**: Use past tense for 'keep' when narrating a past event. 'So I just kept using it, but I still don't like it' or '...but I wasn't happy with it'.

Overall, focus on using consistent past tense for the story and more specific vocabulary to describe the problem and your feelings.
