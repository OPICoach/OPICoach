Question 
Three that's the end of the situation. There are times when something out of the ordinary happens while traveling. I wonder if you have ever experienced anything surprising, unexpected, or unusual during a trip. Tell me the story of that experience in detail. Start by telling me when and where you were traveling. And then, tell me all the details of that experience, especially about what made it so unforgettable.

Answer 
Okay, I remember one trip to Jeju Island last summer. I was with my family. We planned to go hiking on a mountain, but the weather was suddenly changed. It was sunny in the morning, but in the afternoon, it started raining very heavily. We were already on the mountain. We didn't have umbrella or raincoats. We were totally wet. It was unexpected and a little bit dangerous because the path became slippery. We had to go down very carefully. It was a memorable experience because it was unplanned and we had to deal with it together.

Feedback 
Your story about the unexpected rain in Jeju is clear and addresses the prompt well. Here's some feedback:

1.  **'the weather was suddenly changed'**: 'the weather suddenly changed' or 'the weather changed suddenly' is more natural. 'was changed' implies something or someone changed it.
2.  **'It was sunny in the morning, but in the afternoon, it started raining very heavily'**: Good contrast and description.
3.  **'We were already on the mountain'**: Good.
4.  **'We didn't have umbrella or raincoats'**: 'We didn't have umbrellas or raincoats' (plural) is better.
5.  **'We were totally wet'**: Good.
6.  **'It was unexpected and a little bit dangerous because the path became slippery'**: Clear explanation of why it was dangerous.
7.  **'We had to go down very carefully'**: Good use of 'had to'.
8.  **'It was a memorable experience because it was unplanned and we had to deal with it together'**: Good concluding sentence explaining why it was memorable.

Overall, your narration is good. Pay attention to small grammatical points like subject-verb agreement and plural forms.
