Question 
Fourteen that's the end of the situation. Have you ever bought something that did not work or was damaged? Tell me about the item you bought that did not function properly or was damaged. Explain what the item was, what was wrong, and what you did to resolve the situation.

Answer 
Yes, I bought a pair of headphones from a big electronics store. When I got home and tried to use them, only one side was working. The other side was completely silent. I was very annoyed because I needed them for my online classes. So, I took them back to the store the next day. I explained the problem to the staff, and they checked the headphones. They agreed that they were faulty. Luckily, I had the receipt, so they gave me a new pair right away. The new ones worked perfectly. It was a bit inconvenient, but the store handled it well.
