Feedback 
The feedback covers several areas to improve fluency and accuracy. Instead of starting with just keywords like 'geography in my country interesting', use introductory phrases such as 'speaking of geography' or 'as for geography', followed by a full sentence like 'that's an interesting question'. When pausing or thinking, incorporate phrases like 'as far as I know', 'as far as I'm concerned', or 'let me think'. For the ending, avoid trailing off and use clear concluding phrases such as 'that's about it', 'that's pretty much about it', 'that's all I can say', or 'that's all I can think of now'. You can also add phrases like 'that's how it goes' or 'that is that'. For specific points in the answer: Instead of 'Korea is a peninsula', it's more natural to say 'Korea is on a peninsula' or 'Korea is one of the countries in Asia on a peninsula'. You can also specify 'on the Korean peninsula'. The phrase 'so it faces the ocean on the three sides' is good and can be combined with the previous point using 'facing the ocean on three sides'. Instead of 'diverse geography', use 'diverse geographical features' as 'geography' is a concept, while 'features' are countable. For expressing the percentage of mountains, instead of 'there are 70% of mountains', use structures like 'Korea consists of about 70% of mountains', 'about 70% of its landscape/area/territory is mountain', or 'mountains occupy about 70% of Korea's land area'. Finally, when talking about a potential visit, use the conditional 'if you come to Korea' instead of 'when you are coming to Korea'.
