Question 
How should someone starting English for the first time begin OPIc study? How can they guarantee success with time and effort, improve speaking skills, build sentences, and achieve a 'buttery' pronunciation?

Answer 
The speaker provides detailed guidance on starting OPIc study from scratch, focusing on pronunciation, study routines (input vs. output), sentence building, and using resources to improve naturalness and fluency.

Feedback 
To improve pronunciation, understand the schwa sound and practice with correct stress and intonation. Use voice dictation to check accuracy. For study, balance input (memorizing) with output (practicing retrieval). For sentence building, learn by sound and practice shadowing regularly using materials like OPIc 101/150 sentences. Use Google Translate for standard pronunciation and YouGlish for natural, real-world examples from YouTube videos. Prioritize memorizing by sound over text for faster progress.
