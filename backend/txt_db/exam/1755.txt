Question 
When did you learn how to ride a bicycle and who taught you? How did you first become interested in riding a bicycle?

Answer 
When I was like five or six years old, I think I was taught how to ride a bike from my dad. And it was a memorable experience because um you know, he cheered me a lot. He cheered me a lot.

Feedback 
The structure is good, mentioning the age, who taught you, and the feeling/reason. However, the word 'cheered' sounds a bit awkward here. Better alternatives would be 'praised me a lot,' 'complimented me a lot,' or 'encouraged me quite a lot.'
