Question 
Did you ever get in trouble when you borrowed a household appliance and broke it? What kind of problem was it? How did you handle it?

Answer 
There was a time I had to borrow my boyfriend's vacuum cleaner because mine was broken. And I somehow broke my boyfriend's one also. So I was really in trouble.

Feedback 
Good job connecting this to the previous answer by mentioning the vacuum cleaner again. Using 'in trouble' here is a bit awkward; it's usually for being scolded by parents or teachers. Saying 'he was upset' or 'he was annoyed' would be more natural in this context.
