Question 
Tell me about the furniture that you had in your childhood home. Was there anything different from the furniture that you have today? Describe for me what your home looked like at the time.

Answer 
In my current home I have a couch. I mean I have a sofa and it is very small and so I hate it.

Feedback 
This is a very clean and effective main point focusing on the present. For comparison questions like this, it's a great strategy to describe the present first, then the past, using opposite characteristics (e.g., small vs. big sofa) to make the comparison clear and easy for the rater to follow.
