Question 
I would like to know how people dress in your country. What kinds of clothes do they wear for work or leisure?

Answer 
I think people usually wear black and white clothes when they go to work. And I think that's because black and white is safe color.

Feedback 
This is a strong AL main point because you provide the 'why' (it's a safe color). When the question asks about 'people,' focus on describing people's habits or preferences first, and then you can briefly mention your own in the body if you want to.
