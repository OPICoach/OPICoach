Question 
Talk about a time when you went to buy some clothes. What did you buy and what was special about that shopping experience?

Answer 
There was a time where I needed to buy a pair of pants. So I went to the mall. But at the time I was so, so, so broke. So I ended up buying a cheapest one. That was the most terrible experience.

Feedback 
This is a great main point. You clearly state the situation (needed pants, went to the mall), the problem ('so broke'), the action taken (bought the cheapest one), and the feeling ('terrible experience'). Using 'so broke' is a natural, informal way to say you had no money.
