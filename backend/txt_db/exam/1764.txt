Question 
I'd like to give you a situation to act it out. You are planning on going on a trip. Call a travel agency and ask three or four questions about the trip you want to go on.

Answer 
캐나다 가능한가요? 다음 주 월요일 가능한가요? 얼마인가요?

Feedback 
Asking three simple, direct questions is perfect for Role Play 11. Focusing on key information like destination, date, and price is a very effective strategy. Asking about the price last is also a good habit as it's a common element in RP questions.
