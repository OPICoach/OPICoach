Question 
I'm sorry, but there's a problem I need you to resolve. Let's assume that you bought a flight ticket. However, you cannot leave on the day that you are supposed to depart because of an emergency. Call the travel agency, explain the situation and provide two or three alternatives to resolve the problem.

Answer 
전에 환불 받을 수 있을까요? 환불 받을 수 있을까? 안 된다고요? 네. 그러면은 이제 다음 달로 미룰 수 있을까요? 아, 된다고요? 그럼 finish.

Feedback 
This is a perfect approach for Role Play 12. You only need to provide two alternatives. Asking for a refund and then rescheduling are very common and logical solutions for a flight problem. Keep it simple and direct.
