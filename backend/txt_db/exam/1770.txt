Feedback 
The question asks about an 'appointment' (예약), not a casual meeting (약속). Meeting friends is not an appointment (like a doctor, dentist, or hair appointment). This answer does not address the core question. The answer is also too long (1 minute 10 seconds) for the target level (IM1/IL aiming for IH), which should be around 30-40 seconds maximum. The answer contains grammatical errors and awkward phrasing: 'with my university students' is confusing; 'We are very long time long time ago' is awkward, better to say 'We haven't seen each other for a long time' or 'It's been a while since we met'; excessive use of 'and' makes the answer difficult to follow and too long; mentioning multiple topics (boyfriends, jobs, stories) makes the answer scattered; 'talking with boyfriends and job job story' is awkward; 'taking many funny stories' is awkward, 'funny' vs 'fun' confusion, consider 'hilarious' or 'enjoyable'; 'women are many conversations and talking any actions' is grammatically incorrect; 'We are taking we are drinks cup of coffee' is grammatically incorrect, should be 'We drank coffee' or 'We had coffee'. The MP+2 strategy (Main Point + 2 supporting details) should be used, focusing on one specific appointment type (e.g., dentist) and adding two brief details. Time expressions like 'a few days ago' are better placed after the first sentence or in the middle for a more natural flow.
