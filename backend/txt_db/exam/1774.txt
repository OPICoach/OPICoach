Answer 


Feedback 
The speaker recommends using "over the weekend" when asking about weekend activities, stating it sounds more natural and 고급스럽습니다 (sophisticated/advanced) compared to "on the weekend" or "in the weekend". He explains that "over" gives the feeling of covering the entire weekend period. Additionally, the speaker mentions that structure is important for OPIc answers, especially if you cannot freestyle well, as it helps make the message clearer and easier to understand.
