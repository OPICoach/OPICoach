Question 
Imagine that you have moved into a new building. Call the manager of the building and ask three or four questions about recycling.

Answer 
Hi, this is Chloe Troy calling and I'm calling because I'm not sure about the recycling system in the building. I have a few questions if you don't mind. Well actually um this is my first time recycling and I have no idea about recycling system. So um I mean what items are okay in the recycling bins? (React: Oh, I need to separate them into paper, glass, cans and plastics. Okay, I got it. Thanks.) Oh then where is the recycling bin located? (React: Oh, near the mailbox. Yeah, all right. I see.) Oh, hey, one last thing. Then uh when is the recycling pick up? (React: Oh, every Wednesday. Okay, I got it. I got it. Oh I see.) Oh, thanks a lot for your help. Thanks anyway.

Use 'this is [Your Name] calling' for business calls. Clearly state the purpose: 'I'm calling because...'. Use phrases like 'I'm not sure about...' or 'I have no idea about...' when you don't know something. 'This is my first time -ing' is useful for new experiences. For questions, think of 6 Ws and 1 H (What, Where, When). Examples: 'What items are okay in the recycling bins?', 'Where is the recycling bin located?', 'When is the recycling pick up?'. Add simple reactions after asking a question, pretending to hear the answer (e.g., 'Oh, I got it', 'Okay, I see', 'Yeah, all right'). Conclude naturally, like 'Thanks a lot for your help'.
