Question 
What is the recommended study method for OPIc discussed in this video?

Answer 
The video strongly recommends practicing 'shadowing' (따라 말하기) as a study method for OPIc. This involves listening to native English speakers, particularly from sources like TED talks, dramas, movies, or English YouTubers, and repeating what they say.

Feedback 
Excellent summary of the core recommendation! Shadowing is indeed highlighted as a very effective method. The instructor emphasizes several key techniques for successful shadowing: 1. Start by listening carefully and repeating sentences, either immediately after or simultaneously. 2. Adjust the speed, beginning with slower speeds (like 0.75x) and gradually moving to normal speed. 3. For longer sentences, break them down into smaller chunks to practice. 4. Crucially, incorporate gestures, facial expressions, and 'acting' to convey emotion and improve delivery. 5. Pay close attention to intonation, stress, and rhythm, trying to mimic the speaker's natural flow (e.g., emphasizing certain words like 'think about'). 6. Practice paraphrasing the sentences and applying the structures to your own stories (e.g., changing 'Mount Kilimanjaro' to 'Mount Hallasan' or 'I've been a model' to 'I've been a student'). The main benefit highlighted is that this practice helps make your speech sound more natural, fluent, and emotionally engaging, which is key to getting a good score in OPIc.
