Question 
How is the weather today owner at where you are? Is it cold or warm? Talk about today's weather in detail.

Answer 
It's crazy rainy today. Like super rainy. Thunderstorms, lightning, the whole shebang. But you know personally I love this type of weather. It's so soothing, relaxing. You know what I mean? / It's summer now and it doesn't really rain all that much here in Korea. It's usually just very muggy and annoying. But for some reason today it's a little different. It's just super rainy. Absolutely no sun. And wow, I can't help but to love that.

Feedback 
The whole shebang means 'the whole package' or 'everything'. Muggy means '습하다'. It's important to add emotion or feeling to the answer. Control the topic effectively, potentially mentioning other related weather types or contrasting with typical weather for the season/location. If the question asks about 'people' and a 'topic', you need to control both. This control is crucial for higher grades like IH and AL, especially at difficulty level 6-6.
