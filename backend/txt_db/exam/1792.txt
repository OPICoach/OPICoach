Feedback 
The feedback provided in the text focuses on improving OPIc responses by using a wider range of vocabulary and expressions, particularly emotional language and idioms. Key points include: 1. Enhancing emotional expressions like "It was satisfying" or "It was frustrating" by adding adverbs such as "very," "really," "quite," "deeply," "incredibly," and "extremely." 2. Incorporating idiomatic expressions related to the theme of "cow/bull/ox" (e.g., "Holy cow," "Milking the cow," "Beef," "Take the bull by the horns," "Full of bull," "Bullcrap") to sound more natural and fluent. 3. Avoiding direct, awkward translations or unnatural phrases (like saying "You want to die?" instead of more natural expressions like "You got Beef?"). 4. Emphasizing the importance of the SMART strategy and understanding the OPIc marking criteria (Function, Accuracy, Content/Context, Text time) which evaluators use.
