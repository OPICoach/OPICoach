Question 
Tell me about a memorable or embarrassing experience you had.

Answer 
Well, okay, let me tell you about a problem of me letting it rip in front of my wife at the beach. And it was one of the most embarrassing things I had to go through, right? And we were in Spain and we were just finding a nice spot at the beach. And as I was bending over to pick up something, um, you know, something came out and my wife was laughing so hard. And, you know, the way she was laughing, I was just so embarrassed. Um, you know, and I started to laugh too, of course. But I couldn't believe that happened, you know? Like it was so loud. We were outside at the beach and yet, you know, it was as clear as day and I could never forget that moment. So basically, whenever we go to any beach, my wife always reminds me of this story.
