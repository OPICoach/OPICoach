Question 
Describe the efforts people make for their careers. What do people do to prepare for a job? Why do people make such an effort? What companies or industries do people in your country want to work for these days? Why do they want to work for those companies? Can you give me special examples of the industry or company?

Answer 
People make various efforts for their careers, like preparing for jobs. Many people in my country want to work for companies in promising industries like electronics. For example, many people, including myself and my friends, hope to get a job at Samsung. Personally, I believe Samsung is a great place to work because they keep growing and making good quality products. I hope I'll have the opportunity to work there.
