Question 
Can you provide details about a significant historical incident that has impacted the relationship between your country and one of its neighboring nations? This incident may include the signing of a treaty between two countries, a cultural event, or the visit of a foreign minister or president.

Answer 
This question is not easy to answer for me. You know, the relationship between South Korea and other countries can be different, you know, depending on people's political views. One thing I can say is that, as I mentioned earlier, South Korea has done a lot of business with many countries (or South Korea has had a lot of economic exchanges with many countries), but it didn't get much attention for its culture. However, Korean culture, especially K-pop music, has become popular, and many people now like Korean music and are interested in Korea. And thanks to the popularity of Korean music, you know, tourism in Korea has become very promising. I wish I knew more about politics and economics to explain further. The only thing that I can say is that Korea is getting a lot of attention for its culture, which it didn't get before.

This is also a very challenging question, often appearing as a high-level combo question. It's acceptable to acknowledge the difficulty ('this question is not easy to answer for me'). Mentioning differing political views ('depending on people's political views') is a way to navigate sensitive topics. Referencing previous points ('as I mentioned earlier') is natural. Focusing on cultural impact (K-pop, tourism becoming 'promising') is a safe and relatable approach. Phrases like 'I wish I knew more about...' are good for expressing limitations while still speaking English. For IH/AL, it's possible to pass difficult combo questions by stating you've already said everything or don't have enough knowledge, using fluent English to do so.
