Question 
Tell me about a time you had to communicate in a foreign language in a practical situation, like dealing with a service or bureaucracy.

Answer 
When I tried to dispose of my bed, I had to talk in Korean. I said things like 'My Korean's bad'. I wanted to say 'I'm trying to throw away bed'. I heard something like 'need a sticker'. Someone told me 'Please come here'. On a form, they said 'Write your name and sign here' and 'Write your name and address here'. For the pickup date, I heard 'at Tuesday'.

Feedback 
Let's look at some of the phrases you used or heard:
- 'My Korean's bad' is understandable but can sound a bit harsh. A softer and more common phrase is 'My Korean's not good' or even better, 'My Korean's not that good'. Using 'not that good' makes it sound less like a strong self-criticism.
- 'I'm trying to throw away bed' is missing a possessive pronoun. You are trying to throw away *your* bed, so it should be 'I'm trying to throw away my bed'.
- 'I heard need a sticker' is grammatically incomplete. When reporting what you heard about a requirement, you often use a structure like 'I heard you need a sticker'. The 'you' here is general, referring to the requirement for disposing of the item.
- 'Please come here' is correct, but 'Please come over here' is a very natural and common way to say this, using 'come over' to indicate coming to a specific location.
- 'Write your name and sign here' and 'Write your name and address here' are correct. However, adding 'over' as in 'sign over here' or 'address over here' is also very common and sounds natural, especially when pointing to a specific spot. 'Over here' and 'here' often pair well.
- 'at Tuesday' is incorrect. For specific days of the week (like Tuesday) or specific dates (like March 31st), the correct preposition is 'on'. So it should be 'on Tuesday'. Use 'in' for less specific periods like months (in March) or years (in 2023).
