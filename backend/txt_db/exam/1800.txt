Question 
Talk about one of the rising industries or companies in your country. Why is that industry or company famous and what is special about it?

Answer 
All right. Well, I actually don't exactly know that which category is suitable for my subject, but I think the food industry is better because I want to talk about the way of the ordering food in restaurant.

Feedback 
The control strategy (general to singular) is a bit awkward and not neat. The phrase "I actually don't exactly know that which category is suitable for my subject" takes about 8 seconds and can sound confusing to the grader, potentially limiting the score despite the vocabulary. A smoother control or starting with the main point first is recommended if the control takes too long or is not neat.
