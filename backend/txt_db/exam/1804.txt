Question 
What kind of music do you like and why do you like it? When and where do you listen to music? And how do you listen to music?

Answer 
I like a variety of music. I like alternative music. I like some pop. I like some Korean pop, and I love some Korean alternative music. And why do I like it? I tend to like more acoustic music, so it calms me down and it chills me out, so that's why I like that kind of music. And artists like IU and uh, sorry. Artists like IU or Minseul, which is a slightly, uh, more less known artist. They really relax me after a long day of work, so that's what I seek out in my music. I also like to have music where when I'm walking through town, I feel like I'm in a movie. So I like the music to match my mood and where I'm at. And I listen to music mostly on my phone via iTunes. So I will download music from iTunes or I will pull it off of YouTube and listen to it via YouTube. So, first, I love to listen to music. I listen to it all the time. I listen to it in my home, and then I also listen to it especially on my way to work and also on my way back home. Um, I'm always listening to it when I'm walking on the streets. Yeah. I usually use my Bluetooth headphones. I recently bought those and they're really, really nice. I love them, but I'm afraid that I'm going to lose them at some point. I'm mostly listening to pop music nowadays. I try to listen to Korean music sometimes, but I I just like pop music a little bit better. Uh, my favorite singer at the moment is Taylor Swift. I really like her songs. They're very like bright and poppy and just kind of happy to listen to.

Feedback 
You can sing in the test like Anna did. Try practicing phrases like "do you know a song? [song title]" and "the song goes like this".
