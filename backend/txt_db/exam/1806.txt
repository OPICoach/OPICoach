Question 
Tell me about the popular free time locations in your country. What do people usually do there and why are the places popular?

Answer 
In Korea, there are many popular free time locations. Let me talk about my favorites. To start with, Han River Park is a popular place for many people. There are 12 different Han River Parks along the Han River. And the parks provide breathtaking scenery. Oh, and there are convenience stores that sell chicken, beer, and many other things. Another place people love to visit is the Olympic Stadium. The place offers great concerts. It's really big and has state of the art facilities. Moreover, there are many restaurants and cafes nearby. It opens 24/7. The last time I went there was to see a BTS concert. I really had a great time. I hope I can visit these places again in the near future.

Mention more than one popular free time location. Use the present tense when describing what people usually do. Explain why the places are popular. Use natural transition words like 'to start with', 'oh and', 'another' instead of 'first, second, third'. The sentence 'There are 12 different Han River Parks along the Han River' can be used for various topics (geography, parks, free time). 'Breathtaking scenery' can be replaced with 'amazing' or 'fantastic'. Practice the pronunciation of 'breathtaking'. 'Many other things' can be replaced with 'and so on'. 'State of the art facilities' is a useful phrase for modern facilities. 'Moreover' is good for adding points. 'It opens 24/7' means it's open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Use specific examples of your visits (e.g., seeing a concert) and use the past tense for these examples. A concluding sentence like 'I hope I can visit these places again in the near future' is good.
