Question 
Are there popular free time activities in your country? If so, what are they and are the activities seasonally different?

Answer 
People enjoy various activities according to seasons. In spring and fall, many people go to Han River Park for jogging, enjoying the cool breeze, and having chicken and beer. In summer, it's scorching hot. So people go to a nearby beach and enjoy water sports. In winter, since it's freezing cold in Korea, people do not enjoy outdoor activities. Many people stay at home and become couch potatoes with beers. These are the popular free time activities people do in Korea.

Feedback 
Acknowledge that activities vary according to seasons. Describe activities for different seasons (spring/fall, summer, winter). Use descriptive adjectives like 'scorching hot' (very hot) and 'freezing cold' (very cold). Mention specific activities for each season (e.g., jogging, chicken and beer at Han River; beach, water sports in summer; staying home, couch potatoes in winter). Note the difference between 'water sports' and 'winter sports'. 'Couch potatoes' is a good idiomatic expression for someone who spends a lot of time sitting or lying on a sofa, typically watching television. Pay attention to the pronunciation of 'beach' (long 'ee' sound). If contractions like 'don't' or 'can't' are difficult, use the full forms 'do not' or 'cannot'. Be prepared for questions that ask about seasonal differences in other topics as well (e.g., parks, festivals).
