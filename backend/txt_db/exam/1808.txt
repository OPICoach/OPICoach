Question 
Describe a company or industry in your country that is attractive to workers. When did this company or industry start and how has it grown? What has made this company or industry so attractive to workers?

Answer 
I don't think people just want to work for a certain company. Um, they choose their job depending on their like priority. If you want to make a lot of money, you know, you work for a company that offers a high salary. On the other hand, if you want to have enough spare time, um, you work for a company that um doesn't give you too much work. In fact, you know, lots of people in my age want to work for a major company, um, like Samsung Electronics. You might know about their smartphones, you know, Samsung Galaxy S series. Um, this company is a multinational company, you know. I think the reason why um people want to work for this kind of company so bad is they offer high salary plus they have great benefits. I don't know much about this company, you know. The only thing that I know is that it started off as a small electronics company and, you know, it has grown remarkably since their mobile devices became popular all around the world. Um, so I think people choose their job, you know, depending on what they want the most. I mean, people want to work for companies that bring what they want the most to them.

Feedback 
This answer uses varied vocabulary (priority, remarkably, so bad), transition words (On the other hand, In fact, So, I mean), modal verbs (might), and fillers (you know, um) for a natural flow. It provides specific examples (Samsung Electronics, Galaxy S series) and uses phrases like 'I don't think' and 'I think' to soften statements. It also demonstrates the ability to handle parts of the question by admitting limited knowledge ('I don't know much about this company') while still providing relevant information about growth and popularity.
