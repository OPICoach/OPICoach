Question 
Talk about one of the rising industries or a company in your country. Why is that industry or company famous and what is special about it? Do you personally want to work in the industry or a company?

Answer 
Um, IT industry in Korea has been doing well at home and abroad. I once read an article that said Korea has been leading the Fourth Industrial Revolution. You know, Korean companies that make smartphones, um, appliances and cars have been adopting artificial intelligence. For example, you know, my smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy S20, has AI based voice recognition technology. Um, I also heard that Korea is a leader in internet banking. As a matter of fact, the first digital only bank kicked off a couple of years ago. It's called Kakao Bank. which was created by Korea's messaging service company KakaoTalk. You can transfer money directly to your friends on your messenger, um, without typing bank account numbers by using Kakao Bank.

Feedback 
This response effectively uses the present perfect continuous ('has been doing well', 'have been adopting') indicating higher grammatical range. It incorporates transition phrases ('I once read an article that said', 'For example', 'I also heard that', 'As a matter of fact') and fillers ('Um', 'You know'). The answer includes specific examples (Samsung Galaxy S20, Kakao Bank, KakaoTalk) and relevant technical terms (Fourth Industrial Revolution, artificial intelligence, AI based voice recognition technology, internet banking, digital only bank). It also uses varied verbs ('kicked off' instead of 'started') and helpful structures like 'It's called' and relative clauses ('which was created by'). A pronunciation tip for 'can' is also highlighted.
