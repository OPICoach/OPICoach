Feedback 
Sam explains the three main uses of the word 'get' with examples: 1. To obtain something (e.g., 'I really need to get a girlfriend', 'I finally got a car'). 2. To arrive at a place (e.g., 'When did you get back from Toronto?', 'I just got home'). 3. To show a change in state (e.g., 'It's getting so stuffy here', 'The summer's getting so hot', 'It got awkward'). Sam also explains how these meanings are related, suggesting the second and third uses can be seen as a location or state 'obtaining' something.
