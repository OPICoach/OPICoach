Feedback 
Good use of 'There have been' to describe changes over time. Phrases like 'The biggest difference is that' and 'When it comes to' are excellent for comparison. 'has become simpler' is a useful pattern. Vocabulary like 'built-in', 'simple and modern design', 'fancy designed', 'purchase online', 'wide variety of', 'ready to assemble', 'pricey', 'reasonable prices', and 'quality of products' are appropriate. Using connectors like 'Also', 'What's more', and 'Besides' improves flow. Mentioning online purchase and IKEA adds specific detail. Remember 'furniture' is uncountable.
