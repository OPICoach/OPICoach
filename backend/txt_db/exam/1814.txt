This answer effectively reuses the comparison template from the furniture question, demonstrating flexibility. Key phrases like 'there have been changes', 'The main difference is that', 'used to be very pricey', 'at reasonable prices online', 'The range of options has become wider', 'compared to the ones in the past', and 'The quality of products has become much better' are well-used. 'Decent' is a good vocabulary word (synonym for good). Mentioning the popularity of camping provides context. The structure is clear and easy to follow.
