Question 
Have you heard of any problems or concern that people have regarding new software or new technological products? Please tell me about any problems that new technology cost.

Answer 
Ya, I've definitely heard about some concerns that people have with new technological products especially like smartphones. People are so addicted to them and it can be bad for your health. So I think it's important not to overuse smartphones. And um I think these are all the things I can tell you about the issues regarding your question.

Feedback 
Good job adapting the cell phone issue template to a broader question about new technology. Starting with 'I've definitely heard about some concerns' is a good opening. Focusing on smartphones as a key example of 'new technological products' is smart. Reusing phrases like 'addicted to them' and 'can be bad for your health' is efficient. The concluding sentence 'these are all the things I can tell you about the issues regarding your question' is a useful pattern for ending the response.
