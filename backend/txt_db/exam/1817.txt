Question 
Have you heard any news related to health recently? Do people talk about the topic a lot? Please describe common health related concerns that people have.

Answer 
Um you know there have been a lot of health issues recently. And I think the biggest one is, you know, COVID-19. Um it's really dangerous virus and unfortunately we don't have a cure for it yet, you know. It's really sad that the whole world is like suffering from this disease, you know. What a shame.

Feedback 
Effective use of 'there have been a lot of health issues'. Identifying COVID-19 as a major issue is relevant. Key phrases like 'dangerous virus', 'unfortunately we don't have a cure for it yet', and especially 'suffering from this disease' (using 'suffer from') are strong. 'What a shame' is a good expression to convey feeling. This is a good example of a concise yet fluent AL response to a social issue question.
