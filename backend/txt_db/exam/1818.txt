Question 
What kind of clothes do people in your country usually wear? Do they wear different clothes when they go to work and when they are relaxing? Describe the local attire in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
Main Idea: Acknowledge the question and state the topic. Body (Work): People used to wear business attire to look professional, but it's uncomfortable. Nowadays, most companies let employees wear whatever they want for work efficiency. Example: My friend Joy at Hackers wears a t-shirt and jeans to work. Body (Home/Relaxing): People wear casual/comfortable clothes like PJs or sweats at home. They are super comfy and perfect for chilling. Example: The first thing I do when I get home is change into my PJs. Conclusion: Summarize that's all for this topic.

Feedback 
General Structure: Use MBC (Main Idea, Body, Conclusion). Main Idea: Rephrase the question to show you understand. Body: Organize your points (e.g., work vs. home). Use transition phrases (e.g., 'well actually', 'so', 'oh what's next? oh yeah'). Use filler words/phrases ('you know', 'right?', 'well', 'actually', 'as far as I know') to sound natural and buy time. Use personal examples (friend Joy) to support your points. Keep less detailed parts (like home clothes) brief if another part (work clothes) is more detailed. Conclusion: Clearly signal the end of your answer ('that's about it', 'that's it for this question'). Pronunciation Tips: 'clothes' is pronounced 'close', not 'cloze'. 'interesting' stress is on 'in'. 'used to' is pronounced 'used to'. 'uncomfortable' stress is on 'com'. 'employees' needs the 'is' sound at the end. 'heard' is pronounced 'heard'. 'casual' is pronounced 'casual'. 'perfect' is pronounced 'perfect'. Vocabulary/Phrases: 'attire' means clothes. 'business attire' means formal wear/suit. 'look more professional'. 'uncomfortable'. 'whatever they want'. 'as far as I know'. 'used to + verb' (did in the past, not anymore). 'to improve work efficiency'. 'let employees wear'. 'works for' (a company). 'which is one of the biggest companies' (pattern). 'I heard'. 'a t-shirt' (singular). 'casual clothes'. 'PJs' (pajamas). 'sweats' (sweatpants/shirts). 'comfy' (comfortable, informal). 'perfect for just chilling'. 'the first thing I do when I get home is...'. 'change into'.
