Question 
Gatherings have changed over the years. How are they in the past and how are they now? What are the differences and the similarities?

Answer 
Well, I think first let me start with the similarities. Um overall, we gather and we have gatherings out of necessity. The differences however are that in the past we gathered out of a physical necessity... And I think over time that evolved to be more spiritual... Even today, uh when we think about gathering, we gather in kind of a digital space... And uh overall, I think that's why gatherings no matter what time period you live in, in some way they'll always have some way to be important.

Feedback 
Excellent confidence and intonation. Starting with "Well, I think first let me start with the similarities" is a good, natural strategy. Avoid rigid structures like "First, Second, Third". The main point "we gather and we have gatherings out of necessity" is strong, but placing it immediately after the question would be even better for AL. Using both the verb "gather" and the noun "gatherings" ("we gather and we have gatherings") is an advanced (AL) technique to make sentences longer and more descriptive, similar to saying "people like to wear and are wearing safe colors". The structure of discussing the past, transitioning with "over time," and then discussing the present is very effective and easy to follow. Starting the present discussion with "Even today" effectively connects it to the past. Using small words like "kind of" ("in kind of a digital space") significantly boosts accuracy and fluency, characteristic of AL speakers (e.g., "I think I kind of have a bit of a cold"). Using "overall" for the conclusion is good; adding fillers like "and uh I think overall" makes it sound more natural. The expression "no matter what" in the conclusion is excellent for emphasizing a point across different situations or times. The phrase "in some way" is another great example of using small words to add accuracy and fluency, elevating the answer from IH ("gatherings will always be important") to AL ("gatherings in some way will always be important"). Incorporating idioms is also recommended for higher scores.
