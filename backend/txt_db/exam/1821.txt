Question 
What new electronic gadgets or equipment are people who like music interested in these days? What are they talking about? What new products excite them and why?

Answer 
Let me see. Electronic gadget. Well, actually, I think people usually use their own smartphones to listen to the music. in these days. Uh, you know, uh, it's just because of the convenience. I mean, it's really, really easy to use their own smartphones to listen to the music. For instance, if you really want to listen to trendy hip hop or pop songs, you can use your own smartphones, um, without any other devices. You don't need to bring any other devices. And um, also you can use applications like Melon or YouTube. Uh, by using these kinds of applications, you can easily find any information about the song or the song itself. So, uh, what am I trying to say anyway? The bottom line is, uh, these days people usually use their own smartphones to listen to the music.

Feedback 
The goal for AL is to sound natural, like you're having a conversation. Good use of conversational fillers like "Let me see", "Well, actually", "and you know", "and um", "so uh". Intonation can make fillers sound more natural (e.g., "Let me see?" with rising intonation). Using question words from the prompt with fillers (e.g., "electronic gadgets, huh?") adds naturalness. Grammar corrections: "the music" -> "music", "in these days" -> "these days". Placing adverbs like "actually" mid-sentence rather than at the beginning sounds more natural (e.g., "Well, I think people actually use..."). Similarly, place expressions like "when it comes to" mid-sentence for better flow (e.g., "I think people prefer using their smartphones when it comes to listening to music"). "It's really easy to use their own smartphones" is awkward; better: "It's really easy for them to use their own smartphones" or "It's really, really easy for us to use our own smartphones". Using "us" and "our" sounds more inclusive and smooth. Repeating words like "really, really" for emphasis is good; slightly lengthening and raising the pitch on the second repetition enhances this. The main point (smartphones for music due to convenience/ease) was clear and simple. Examples were good. Self-correction should be natural, not halting the flow. Use fillers to restart smoothly (e.g., "um, without any other devices. I mean, you really don't need any other devices."). The phrase "what am I trying to say anyway?" is a great filler for restarting or summarizing, but needs a slight pause after it. The conclusion "The bottom line is..." is good, but repeating the initial main point too closely makes it less effective as a summary. Vary the phrasing (e.g., "This is why people love using their smartphones for music."). To guarantee AL, focus more on personal feelings and experiences ("you-based") rather than just general observations about people ("people-based"). Talk about people briefly (one or two sentences) and then shift to your own feelings and experiences. Avoid repeating the same words within the same sentence. Show conversation skill and convey feelings, don't just list facts. Avoid sounding scripted.
