Question 
Your friend just took his first dance lesson. You are also considering taking it as well. Ask your friend three or four questions about his first class to see if he should sign up with him.

Answer 
So Jay, I heard that you had the first day of dance lesson. Like what type of dance was it? Oh, hip hop dance, really? I've always wanted to learn hip hop dancing. How many times do you go there? In a week. Oh, three times a week. Wow, maybe I should come with you. What? You're going to pay for me too? I have no excuse not to come. Yeah, definitely. Call me tomorrow.

Feedback 
The answer follows a strategy for Role Play 11. Step 1: Briefly mention the topic (friend's dance lesson). Step 2: Ask the first question (type of dance). Step 3: React to the answer (Oh, hip hop dance). Step 4: Show genuine reaction/emotion (really?). Step 5: Include yourself/relate to the answer (I've always wanted to learn hip hop dancing). Repeat Steps 2-5 for the second question (how often). For the third question (should I come with you?), the pattern is slightly varied: Step 2 (question), Step 3 (reaction to friend's response), then jump directly to Step 5 (including yourself/reaction) to vary the rhythm and avoid sounding scripted. The overall approach emphasizes sounding natural, showing emotion, and varying sentence structure and rhythm.
