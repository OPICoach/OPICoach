Question 
Your friend just took his first dance lesson. You are also considering taking it as well. Ask your friend three or four questions about his first class to see if you should sign up with him.

Answer 
So Jay, I heard that you had the first day of dance lesson. Like what type of dance was it? Oh, hip hop dance? Really? I've always wanted to learn hip hop dancing. How many times do you go there in a week? Oh, three times a week? Wow, maybe I should come with you. What? You're gonna pay for me too? I have no excuse not to come. Yeah, definitely call me tomorrow.

Feedback 
Overall, your response is excellent! You effectively engaged with the scenario, asked relevant questions, and showed genuine interest. Your use of intonation and reaction words like 'Oh,' 'Really?,' 'Wow,' and 'What?' makes the conversation sound very natural and dynamic, which is crucial for OPIc role-plays. You also successfully included your personal feelings and intentions ('I've always wanted to learn...', 'maybe I should come...'), fulfilling the task requirements.

Specific feedback on sentences and words:
-   'So Jay, I heard that you had the first day of dance lesson.' - Good opening to set the context. 'dance lesson' is often used in the plural form, 'dance lessons,' when referring to a series of classes, but 'dance lesson' for the first day is also acceptable.
-   'Like what type of dance was it?' - A very natural and effective first question.
-   'Oh, hip hop dance? Really?' - Excellent use of reactions and intonation to show engagement and interest.
-   'I've always wanted to learn hip hop dancing.' - Great job connecting the topic to yourself and expressing your long-held interest.
-   'How many times do you go there in a week?' - This question is slightly awkward given the context that it was the friend's *first* day. It implies a regular schedule already exists. A more natural question in this context would be 'How often are you planning to go?' or 'How many times a week will the lessons be?' or 'How often are you thinking about going?' as suggested in the transcript.
-   'Oh, three times a week?' - Good reaction to the assumed answer.
-   'Wow, maybe I should come with you.' - Great expression of interest in joining.
-   'What? You're gonna pay for me too?' - Excellent reaction showing surprise and excitement. The informal phrasing 'gonna' is perfectly fine and adds to the naturalness of the conversation.
-   'I have no excuse not to come.' - A natural and enthusiastic way to express your decision.
-   'Yeah, definitely call me tomorrow.' - A good, natural closing that suggests a follow-up action.

Your response demonstrates strong communication skills, including asking questions, reacting to information, and expressing personal interest, all within a natural conversational flow. Keep up the great work!
