Question 
Intermediate level prompts (chosen topics) and Advanced level prompts (unexpected topics, time frame questions, comparison tasks).

Answer 
Spoke mostly in simple sentences on chosen topics. Asked questions in role play. On advanced topics, showed little ability to elaborate with paragraph structure and detail, little control over major time frames, and relied on rehearsed material (e.g., comparing homes). Needed a sympathetic listener to be understood.

Feedback 
Candidate performed at the intermediate level on chosen topics but struggled significantly on advanced topics. Key issues identified were lack of paragraph structure, poor control of tenses (major time frames), reliance on rehearsed material (especially in comparison tasks), and difficulty being understood. Recommendations for improvement include practicing tenses (especially past), avoiding rehearsed/repeated answers, practicing speaking in paragraph units (using keywords), and expanding vocabulary for unexpected topics.
