Question 
What kinds of appointments do you make in your life? Where do you go to make your appointments?

Answer 
All right, so I made an appointment with my OBGYN doctor. When I was pregnant, so I went to see my doctor every four weeks. So I needed to make my appointment every four weeks before until I delivered. So, uh, yeah, that's my uh, appointment before I that I I have experienced. Is there is that right?

Feedback 
The answer correctly understood 'appointment' as a formal meeting or 예약 (like with a doctor) rather than a casual 약속. The teacher confirmed this was a very good answer and exactly what was wanted for this question.
