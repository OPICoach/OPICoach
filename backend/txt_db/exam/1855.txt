Feedback 
The student misunderstood the question, which asked about an appointment *you* made *as a child*. The answer started talking about appointments *for my children*. This highlights the critical importance of fully understanding the question's subject and tense. Misunderstanding the question leads to an incorrect answer, regardless of English fluency.
