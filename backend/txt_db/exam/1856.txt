Question 
You've indicated that you go to coffee shops. Tell me about the cafes in your community.

Answer 
Um there are a lot of cafes in my community. I mean, there are even four Starbucks in my neighbor. neighborhood and two of Tom and Toms and one coffee. but um the point what I love is that there are a lot of franchise coffee shop in my neighborhood. Yeah, of course, there are private coffee shops in my neighborhood, but sometimes whenever I go to a private coffee shop, I felt like I felt some pressure from the from the owner because I felt like I had to go out fast and drinking fast. But whenever I go to a Starbucks, they don't care about me. So, I can sit there for like five hours, six hours, how much ever I want. Uh so, that's why I love uh 이거 맞나요?

Feedback 
The S (Situation) part is too complex and lists too many places initially. It should quickly focus on a main point (e.g., a favorite cafe like Starbucks). Avoid starting negatively or too honestly if it limits what you can say. The M (Mistake/More) part has a mispronunciation issue ('private' sounds like 'pre-made' or 'prebit'). It also lacks variety, focusing only on one aspect (feeling pressured vs. being left alone). A smoother transition from S to M is needed. The A (Advantage/Again) part shows confusion ('이거 맞나요?') and doesn't clearly return to the main point established in S (coffee quality). The R (Realized) part is missing. Overall, the answer lacks clear structure, varied points in the M part, and needs better transitions between sections. Specific word choices like 'neighbor' instead of 'neighborhood' and 'how much ever I want' could be improved. Avoid bringing up unrelated topics like McDonald's, other restaurants, or cakes in the A part if the main point is coffee.
