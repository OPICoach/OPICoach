Question 
What kind of OPIC should I do these days to get IH? It seems like I got IM2 even if I did something strange 6 months ago, but these days, the score is a bit stingy, and they give IM1. Has the standard gone up?

Answer 
The speaker explains the OPIC rating criteria, specifically differentiating IM1, IM2, and IH based on the unit of speech production (words/phrases, sentences, strings of sentences, connected sentences, paragraphs). IM1 is characterized by speaking in single sentences with pauses. IM2/IM3 use 'strings of sentences' and 'connected sentences' (using conjunctions, relative pronouns). IH requires speaking in 'paragraphs' (5-7 continuous sentences), using complex sentence structures, handling unexpected situations (like in Q12), discussing social issues to some extent, and using a variety of tenses accurately.

Feedback 
To move from IM1 to IH, focus on speaking continuously rather than in short, disconnected sentences. Practice connecting sentences to form 'strings of sentences' and 'connected sentences' using conjunctions and relative pronouns. Aim to speak in 'paragraphs' (5-7 continuous sentences). Incorporate complex sentence structures (e.g., 'What I think is that...', 'The reason why... is that...'). Practice handling unexpected situations, especially in role-play scenarios (Q12), ensuring you can successfully address complications. Develop the ability to discuss social issues to some extent and demonstrate accurate and varied use of tenses.
