Question 
Tell me about a restaurant you ate out at recently. What kind of restaurant was it? What was their menu and what did you eat? Who did you go with? Did you like how the food tasted?

Answer 
well recently i visit the restaurant with my wife the cold oh i'll back and i ordered the tbone steak it was really delicious especially my baby really love that tbone steak

Feedback 
The answer is too short and ends abruptly. For the sentence 'recently i visit the restaurant with my wife', 'visit' should be in the past tense ('visited') because it is a past experience question. 'went to a restaurant' is also a good alternative.
