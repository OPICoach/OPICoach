Feedback 
The start 'alright appointment i went to as a child let me think' is natural and uses fillers well. However, 'it was like 13 or 14' is awkward when referring to age; it should be 'I was like 13 or 14'. Adding 'or something' ('I was like 13 or 14 or something') can sound more natural. The answer focuses too much on factual details (time, actions like playing soccer) and not enough on feelings or emotions, which are crucial for higher grades. The word 'appointment' typically refers to formal bookings (like doctor, interview), not casual plans like playing soccer; 'plan' is better for casual meetings. When examples are given in the question (doctor, dentist, new school), choosing one of them is recommended as it directly addresses the prompt.
