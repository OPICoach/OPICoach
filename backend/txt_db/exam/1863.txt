Question 
Tell me about your favorite type of weather. What kind of weather do you like the most? Why?

Answer 
I like sunny weather. I like sunny weather because it makes me feel happy. When the sun is shining, I feel energetic and optimistic. I like to do outdoor activities when the sun is shining, such as going for a walk or playing sports. Sunny weather also makes me feel warm and comfortable. I think sunny weather is the best kind of weather.

Vocabulary: The vocabulary used is simple and clear. Words like 'energetic' and 'optimistic' are good choices to describe feelings. To enhance the description, you could use a wider range of adjectives to describe the weather itself (e.g., glorious, bright, pleasant, warm, clear) and the activities (e.g., leisurely walk, vigorous sports). Avoid repeating 'sunny weather' multiple times; use pronouns or synonyms where appropriate. Sentence Structure: The sentences are grammatically correct and easy to understand. You use a good mix of simple sentences and one complex sentence ('When the sun is shining...'). To make your response flow more smoothly, you could try combining some sentences using conjunctions (like 'and', 'but', 'so') or transition words (like 'also', 'furthermore', 'in addition'). For example, you could combine the first two sentences: 'I like sunny weather because it makes me feel happy.' This creates a more natural flow. Overall, a good start, but expanding vocabulary and varying sentence structure will make your response more dynamic.
