Question 
How are cafes and coffee houses like in your childhood? Were they really popular? Describe what you remember in detail.

Answer 
All right. Okay. Let me start off by saying this. I think these days cafes are well, just so amazing. Simply because you can stay there for long hours and no one's gonna say anything to you. I think that's really cool, right? Because like back in the days it wasn't quite like this. I mean, if you're to stay there for like three hours or so, if the boss were to be there they give you the cut eye. And that wouldn't be a great feeling at all. And so you'd feel burdened, you feel forced to buy a lot more things so that you could stay there longer. Yeah, that completely sucked. But these days, wow, what a completely different story. You can pretty much go to any cafe. Just order a single cup of coffee and that gives you the right to stay there for many hours. And I think that's awesome. I mean you could study, you could have long conversations with a friend, whatever you want. Just buy one cup of coffee can let you stay there and that wouldn't be considered loitering. It would just be normal. And so you know what? Thank you cafes for being so cool these days.

Feedback 
The feedback highlights key strategies for an AL score, including using fillers ('like', 'I mean') for natural flow, employing repetition (Rule ) with structures like 'if...if', 'you'd feel...you'd feel', and 'you could...you could'. It emphasizes effectively contrasting past and present experiences with specific vocabulary ('back in the days', 'it wasn't quite like this', 'cut eye', 'sucked' vs. 'these days', 'amazing', 'many hours', 'awesome', 'wouldn't be considered loitering'). The response also incorporates expressing personal feelings ('I think that's really cool', 'that completely sucked', 'that's awesome'), providing examples using various phrases ('I mean', 'if', 'you can', 'you could'), and using specific expressions like 'quite like this', 'cut eye', 'at all', 'burdened', 'forced', 'pretty much', 'gives you the right', and 'considered loitering'. Skillful pausing (e.g., with 'wow') and a simple, effective conclusion ('And so you know what? Thank you...') are also noted as strong points for an unscripted, conversational style.
