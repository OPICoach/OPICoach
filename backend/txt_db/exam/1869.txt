Question 
What do you do from the moment you walk into the bank until you walk out? Tell me everything about what goes on when you visit the bank.

Answer 
Uh, first of all, I wait in the bank in my turn. Uh, because there are lots of people, uh, you know, at the bank. Um, so I wait my turn and um and I meet a bank bank account, you know? Uh, and then, yeah. Uh, uh, first of all, I wait in the bank in my turn.

Feedback 
Your answer starts well with 'First of all'. However, there are several areas for improvement. 'In the bank' should be 'at the bank' when referring to the location. 'In my turn' is awkward; better options are 'when it's my turn' or 'wait for my turn'. Saying 'there are lots of people' is okay, but you could use stronger vocabulary like 'packed' or 'packed full of people' to describe a crowded bank. Repeating 'at the bank' when you seem to run out of ideas is a common issue and should be avoided. The phrase 'meet a bank bank account' is incorrect; you likely meant 'bank teller' or 'bank employee'. While you corrected yourself by moving on, identifying and using the correct term is important. To improve your score (e.g., from IH to AL), try to elaborate more and connect your ideas smoothly. Adding details about your feelings (e.g., 'I hate waiting') or using expressions like 'I do a whole lot of waiting' or 'I have no choice but to wait' can make your response richer and demonstrate better fluency. Aim for more sentences per minute by expanding on your points rather than repeating them.
