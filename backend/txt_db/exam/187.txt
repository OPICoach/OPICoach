Question 
Describing a living room (as an example for practicing answering techniques)

Answer 
The text demonstrates techniques for making answers more impactful. Examples include repeating a key adjective (like 'good' or 'incredible') using a 'How...?' question structure ('It's really good. How good? Like amazingly good.') and adding a descriptive phrase followed by the adjective ('It's bigger than any castle. Incredible.').

Feedback 
The teacher explains that these techniques make the answer sound more natural and show genuine feeling, which impresses evaluators and can boost grammar scores. Using the 'It's...' structure is suggested as a simple starting point. A strong warning is given against using language (like profanity) that does not match the speaker's natural style, as it can sound fake and negatively impact the score. Consistent practice is emphasized as necessary to make these techniques sound natural.
