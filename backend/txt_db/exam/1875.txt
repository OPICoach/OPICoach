Answer 
My chair makes me feel comfortable.

Feedback 
Using 'makes me feel comfortable' is often awkward, especially for tangible objects like a chair. A better way is 'My chair is so comfortable' or 'My chair is very comfortable'. 'My chair is so relaxing' is also a good alternative. Avoid the 'makes me feel' pattern when possible, especially with 'comfortable'.
