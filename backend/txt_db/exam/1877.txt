Answer 
Talking with my coworker makes me feel comfortable.

Feedback 
When talking about situations (like talking with someone), 'makes me feel comfortable' is awkward because the situation isn't tangible. A much more natural expression is 'Talking with my coworker puts me at ease'. 'Puts me at ease' means makes me feel relaxed and comfortable in that situation.
