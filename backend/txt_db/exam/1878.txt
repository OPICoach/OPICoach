Answer 
That cafe makes me feel comfortable.

Feedback 
Using 'makes me feel comfortable' for a place like a cafe is awkward. Alternatives include 'That cafe puts me at ease'. You could also say 'It's a very relaxing cafe' or 'That cafe makes me feel relaxed'. To express it feels like home, use 'That cafe feels like my home' or 'That cafe makes me feel like I'm home'. The pattern 'makes me feel like...' is much smoother than just 'makes me feel...'.
