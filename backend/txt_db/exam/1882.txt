Feedback 
The answer is generally good and shows fluency, sufficient for IH but needs refinement for Advanced. Key areas for improvement are related to grammatical accuracy, particularly subject-verb agreement and the use of countable/uncountable nouns.

Specific feedback points:
1.  **Subject-Verb Agreement (수일치):** This is highlighted as a major area where errors are easily spotted by graders and prevent higher scores.
2.  **Uncountable Nouns:**
    *   `informations`: Incorrect. Information is uncountable. Use `information` or `pieces of information`.
    *   `advices`: Incorrect. Advice is uncountable. Use `advice` or `pieces of advice`. `Advices` can mean legal notices, which is not the intended meaning here.
    *   `contents`: When referring to general content (like on Netflix or YouTube), use `content` (uncountable). `Contents` (plural) usually refers to a list of items or physical contents.
    *   `YouTubes`: Incorrect. Refer to the platform as `YouTube` (uncountable) or specify `YouTube videos`.
    *   `viruses`: When referring to COVID-19, it's typically referred to as `the COVID-19 virus` or `the COVID-19 pandemic/situation`, not plural `viruses` in this context.
3.  **Verb Usage (`provide`):** The structure `provide us customized contents` is less common. The correct structures are typically `provide [person] with [thing]` (e.g., `provide us with customized content`) or `provide [thing] for [person]` (e.g., `provide customized content for us`).
4.  **General Accuracy:** While fluent, minor grammatical slips, especially regarding countable/uncountable nouns and verb structures, need to be eliminated for an Advanced score. Consistent accuracy is key for Advanced.
