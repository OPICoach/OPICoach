Feedback 
Sentence 1: "The park here in my town is very amazing place." - Incorrect article usage. Should be "is a very amazing place" (because 'very' starts with a consonant sound) or "It's an amazing place" (because 'amazing' starts with a vowel sound). When describing a singular noun like 'place' with an adjective, an article (a/an) is usually needed. Sentence 2: "I guess it's because there is so big." - Incorrect use of 'there is' in this context. Avoid putting 'there' in the middle like this. The 'it' refers to the park, so use 'it' again. Corrected: "I guess it's because it's so big." or simply "It's because it's big/huge/very spacious." Sentence 3: "I really love about spacious place." - Incorrect use of 'about'. The structure "I really love about..." is awkward without a preceding phrase like "What I really love about...". When talking about things in general, use the plural form. Corrected: "I really love spacious parks." Or, if referring to a specific type of park: "I really love a spacious park." Sentence 4: "In there some people stroll the path with dogs." - Incorrect use of "in there". Avoid "in there"; just use "there" or restructure the sentence. "Stroll" is okay but can be awkward without the pattern "go for a stroll". Simpler verbs are better for beginners. Corrected: "There are some people who stroll..." or "Some people go for a stroll with their dogs." A simpler and common phrase is "walk their dogs". Corrected: "Some people walk their dogs at that park." or "Some people like to walk their dogs." Sentence 5: "It's really fantastic." - This sentence is correct and very good. It uses 'It's' (pronoun + verb), 'really' (intensifier), and 'fantastic' (varied adjective). Encourage using 'It's' frequently, intensifiers like 'really', 'so', 'very', 'absolutely', and varied adjectives beyond just 'good' or 'great' (e.g., amazing, spectacular, wonderful, crazy, nice, awesome).
