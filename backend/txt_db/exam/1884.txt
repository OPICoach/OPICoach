Question 
Problems often arise related to transportation. Cars break down, trains run late, or even there are traffic jams, right? Tell me about a transportation problem that you once faced. Tell me everything that happened and what you did to deal with the situation.

Answer 
Um, okay. Um, uh, I just experienced this kind of happening just right, um, you know, um, yesterday. Uh, and, um, when I, uh, got to my car, um, I could, uh, just before, um, start the engine, I heard some, um, electronic, um, weird sound, uh, in the car. So, um, I was pretty scared, um, of, uh, bombing the car, exploring the car. So, um, yeah, that was terribly, um, scared.

Feedback 
You did a relatively good job. However, you seemed over-worried about making a mistake in your main point and started to explain probably a little too much. Try to be a little bit more concise. Just talk about what the problem was, how you felt, and why. You don't have to talk about the solution yet; that part is for the continuation.
