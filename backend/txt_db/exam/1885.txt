Question 
Tell me about a transportation problem that you once faced. (Second attempt, main point)

Answer 
Okay. Um, all right. I just experienced it yesterday, and, uh, um, it was in my car, and, um, I heard, um, some, um, weird noise from the car when I got into my car. And I was overly worried about that because that's the first, uh, that's the very unfamiliar sound.

Feedback 
This is a more concise main point, focusing on the problem (weird sound) and feeling (overly worried) and reason (unfamiliar sound).
