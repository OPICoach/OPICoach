Question 
Tell me about a transportation problem that you once faced. (Continuation after main point)

Answer 
Uh, you know, um, I was really scared, so I was like, "What the heck? Come on, my car. Come on." But, you know, I had no choice but to call some insurance company, and, you know, some, um, repair man, uh, came to me, and he fixed it, fixed it up. Anyway, uh, you know, the having a car is very convenient, and, but, uh, and convenient, and, you know, um, there's a lot of good things, but, you know, uh, when you, uh, experience this kind of some scary things, um, I think it is not good, uh, I, I cannot say the car is the perfect transportation. Interesting.

Feedback 
You attempted to use the 99-1 strategy by mentioning the convenience of a car (99) and then the scary/not good experience (1), but the connection wasn't fully clear initially. When applying 99-1, stick to the main topic (the car problem and fix). For example, talk about the mechanic fixing it well (99), then mention the high cost (1), and return to the car being perfect afterwards (99). Always include the solution or lack thereof in the conclusion.
