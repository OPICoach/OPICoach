Question 
Tell me about a transportation problem that you once faced. (New scenario, main point)

Answer 
Um, recently, uh, I was going to somewhere, and, you know, um, I want to use some subway, but, yeah, there was no problem with train, but, you know, um, because of my own laziness, I missed my train. So, you know, uh, because I was really, really freaked out because, you know, I was, uh, uh, I mean, I'm kind of some punctual man.

Feedback 
This sets up the problem: missing the train due to laziness and being freaked out because you are punctual.
