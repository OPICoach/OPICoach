Answer 
N/A

Feedback 
The 99-1 strategy involves focusing 99% on one main point (e.g., the positive aspects of something, or the negative aspects of a problem) and briefly mentioning the opposite (1%) before returning to the main point. This adds depth to your answer without introducing too many separate ideas. It is particularly effective for the 'Past Experience' category. For example, focusing on how good something was (99), briefly mentioning a small negative point (1), and then returning to how good it was overall (99). Or, focusing on how bad a problem was (99), briefly mentioning a small positive aspect or outcome (1), and then returning to the overall negative experience or consequence (99).
