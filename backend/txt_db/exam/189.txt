Question 
I'm sorry but there is a problem I need you to resolve. Your friend wants you to come over and see his pictures from his trip this evening. However you have another engagement. Call your friend explain why you cannot come by this evening and offer some alternatives.

Answer 
Hey Jozba, what's up man? Yeah, all is good. Great. Alright man look I'm just way too lazy to text everything so that's why I'm calling you now. And I would love to come over but you know I already have a prior engagement tonight so. Mhm. So I'm just wondering why not I come over tomorrow to take a look at your pictures. Mhm. What about that? What about that? No you can't. Whoa why not man? I know you're not busy. Come on don't even pretend that you got something planned. Come on I know you. Oh okay you have plans with your girlfriend. Okay cool cool. Mhm. Alright then uh what about next week instead? Mhm. We're gonna go clubbing anyway. I'll just stop by a little bit earlier. You know you could show me some of your pictures and then we'll hit the club. Yeah that sounds good.

Feedback 
It's crucial to show emotion (감정) in your OPIc answers, not just state facts like a diary. Practicing with journals that include feelings helps develop this. For roleplay questions, understand and use key vocabulary from the prompt, like 'another engagement' or 'prior engagement', which shows the rater you fully grasp the situation. The 'roleplay 12 strategy' involves offering alternatives and handling the friend's response. A strong approach is to offer the first alternative and then ask about it again in a slightly different way ('Why not I come over tomorrow?' followed by 'What about that?'). If the friend says no, repeat their response ('No you can't') and ask 'Why not?'. Add natural conversational elements, even lighthearted ones ('I know you're not busy. Come on don't even pretend...'). Offer a second alternative and explain the plan ('What about next week instead? We're gonna go clubbing anyway...'). Don't be afraid to show natural speech patterns, including repetitions ('cool cool') or slight hesitations; this demonstrates spontaneous speaking rather than reciting a script.
