This is note-taking for a description question. It's better to start with the main point (MP) about the bank itself, not its location or general facts about banks. For example, start with something you like about the bank (e.g., 'The bank that I usually go to is big' or 'has a nice waiting area'). Details like location can go in the body. Focusing on the bank itself is crucial, just like focusing on the house itself, not the neighborhood, for a house question. Using a specific bank name like '하나 bank' is risky as it sounds too Korean; 'Hana bank' or 'this bank' is safer. The pattern 'there's this [noun]' is a good, smooth way to start descriptions (e.g., 'there's this bank near my home'). Avoid overusing 'there's this' in a single answer.
