Question 
Tell me about a restaurant you ate out at recently. What kind of restaurant was it? What was their menu and what did you eat? Who did you go with? Did you like how the food tasted?

Answer 
And you know last month my girlfriends and I decided to go a new restaurant that is called Yellow Chicken. You know what? Before we just went there, I was a little bit nervous actually because you know, she was a little bit sensitive and you know like picky to choose a new restaurant. You know what I mean? But fortunately my decision was definitely right. You know what? The chicken that I ordered before was you know, almost like flawless. You know what I mean? It was like you know, so chewy and we could feel like you know, after taste from this meat. Right? Oh my gosh. If I may be allowed a little exaggerated, you know, it was like another class like you know, Cristiano Ronaldo in the Champions League. You know what I'm talking about, right? So my tongue was screaming for joy. So we had a really great time and then she was like thank you very much. So it was really enjoyable time about the restaurant recently.

Feedback 
The student's initial main point (MP) focused on being nervous about choosing the restaurant. However, the full answer spent significant time describing how amazing the chicken was. The feedback highlights that the MP should align with the main topic discussed in the answer. It is suggested to state the MP (e.g., the amazing chicken) early, provide supporting details (like the nervousness before going), and then return to reinforce the MP. A clear MP at the beginning improves communication and helps the grader understand the core message, especially when there might be grammatical or pronunciation variations. Practice focusing on stating the MP first, then practice the full answer incorporating the MP and details effectively.
