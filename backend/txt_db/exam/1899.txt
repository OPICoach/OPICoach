There are sometimes news reports on food. Food can get contaminated or be affected by dangerous bacteria. Talk about a news report you watched or read about regarding a food scare incident.

Answer 
Um, the most recent one that I can remember was about the lettuce being a problem. So everybody was panicking about eating just regular lettuce. and you know, people are using it as an excuse not to eat their salads. But I wasn't there when this happened, so I didn't really it wasn't a problem for me. Cuz when this was a big deal, it was in the United States. So, um, that's all I remember that, you know, people were staying away from that. And I remember here in Korea, there was a big problem with eggs. 밥을 할 수가 없어요. 그리고 얼마 안 돼요. And a lot of people were and the grocery stores eggs were being more expensive. 쌀 20점 기억이 a lot of people were actually not buying eggs as often cuz it was getting more expensive. Uh, I actually don't eat many eggs either. So it also wasn't a problem for me. But that's what I remember from recent times here in Korea. Perfect.

Feedback 
The student successfully answers the question by talking about specific food scare incidents (lettuce in the US, eggs in Korea). The strategy is to treat this news-based question as a past experience question. The answer is effective because it keeps details simple, focusing on the main issue and people's reactions, as well as the student's personal experience. Key phrases like 'The most recent one I can remember was...' and 'That's all I remember that...' are used effectively. The student uses fillers naturally ('and you know', 'um') and repeats phrases ('a lot of people were... a lot of people were actually...') to clarify after a pause, which sounds natural. The expression 'big deal' is used well. Using indefinite adverbs like 'often' is highlighted as a good skill. The conclusion 'That's what I remember from recent times here in Korea' is simple and effective. Although the student mentions two incidents, focusing on one is recommended for most students to maintain clarity. The feedback also notes a minor grammatical point ('lettuce being a problem') but emphasizes that the message remains clear. A key takeaway is to talk about both the general situation/people's reactions and your own experience.
