Feedback 
This is a description-based question, very common for housing topics. Good use of the filler 'you know' and the natural phrase 'it's just an apartment'. Instead of saying 'I live in a three-bedroom apartment' (which can sound scripted), it's better to describe the number of rooms more naturally. For description questions, focus on one main point or area of your home (like your bedroom or balcony) and describe that in detail using phrases like 'I think' and similes ('it's like a playground'). Be mindful of countable/uncountable grammar like 'there were two bedrooms' instead of 'there was two bedrooms'. If you make a mistake during the test, you can correct yourself immediately or just keep going if you're unsure, but avoid repeating the incorrect phrase multiple times.
