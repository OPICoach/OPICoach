Feedback 
Good use of fillers like 'um, okay, let me see'. The pronunciation of 'Package' should be 'package'. 'watch' should be 'watch'. For a program that continues, use 'there are usually' instead of 'it appeared'. Good use of the filler 'I mean'. The pronunciation of 'woman' should be 'women' (plural). 'woman' should be 'women' (plural) here. Suggestion: 'I must not meet other women'. The phrase 'I can feeling of any people's love' is awkward and should be removed. 'So because of that, I really like it' is a good sentence. The repetition 'I can I can' is natural. The pronunciation of 'woman' should be 'women' (plural). 'woman' should be 'women' (plural) here. Suggestion: 'I can also see very beautiful women'. Good use of the filler 'You know'. 'one of the my pleasure' should be 'one of my pleasures' (plural). 'Overall, I really like that program' is a good conclusion. The sentence 'But my wife know why I watch this program, then she may be kill me' should be improved. Suggestion: 'But if my wife finds out why I'm watching this program, then she will maybe kill me'. The ending 'That's that's all' should be removed in OPIc.
