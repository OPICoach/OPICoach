Question 
Tell me about the outdoor activities that are popular in your country. Do people go hiking, biking, or swimming? What do people typically do outdoors?

Answer 
IM: Korean people love hiking. Because it's healthy. Hiking is a good workout. Korean people also like other activities.
IH: Hiking is the most popular outdoor activity for most Koreans in Korea. Because it's very healthy for us. Whenever we go hiking, it's a good workout. There are also other activities that we like.
AL: I'd say without a doubt, hiking is probably the most popular outdoor activity for pretty much all Koreans here in Korea. Because it's recognized as one of the beneficial activities for our health. And so, whenever we're ready to go hiking, we are ready to have a good workout. Of course, there are also other activities that we favor.

Feedback 
The answer demonstrates different levels of proficiency (IM, IH, AL) by varying sentence structure, vocabulary, and complexity. 

Specific feedback points:
- **IM Level:** Uses simple sentences and vocabulary. Repetitive use of 'Korean people'.
- **IH Level:** Introduces slightly more complex structures ('is the most popular', 'for most Koreans'). Uses important basic adverbs like 'very'. Uses habit-related words like 'whenever'. Starts using pronouns ('we') more effectively. Needs to pay attention to articles ('a good workout').
- **AL Level:** Uses advanced opening phrases ('I'd say without a doubt'). Incorporates adverbs like 'probably' and 'pretty much'. Uses advanced vocabulary and patterns ('recognized as', 'beneficial activities'). Employs transition words/phrases effectively ('And so', 'Of course'). Uses alternative verbs like 'favor' instead of just 'like'. Demonstrates skillful repetition ('ready'). Focuses on smoother transitions and flow.

General Vocabulary & Pattern Feedback:
- **Positive Emotions:** Practice 'please', 'pleased', 'pleasing', 'pleasure'. Useful patterns: 'it pleases me', 'fills me with great pleasure', 'a pleasing outcome'.
- **Negative Emotions:** Practice 'irritate', 'irritated', 'irritation'. Practice R sound. Useful patterns: 'it irritates me', 'an irritating issue', 'causes me great irritation'.
- **Slang:** 'That's bananas' can mean 'that's crazy' for higher levels (IM2+), but requires careful use and practice.
- **Idioms/Sayings:** Pattern 'I believe in [idiom], which is why I...' is advanced and impressive (e.g., 'I believe in the early bird gets the worm, which is why I...'). Practice 'the' before vowel sounds and pausing after 'which is why'.
- **Specific to General Strategy:** Start with a specific example (hiking), transition to general examples (biking, swimming) in the body, and can return to the specific example. This structure is effective for habit questions.
- **Pronunciation:** Practice R sounds in words like 'irritate', 'recognize', 'ready'. Also practice words with silent letters like 'doubt'.
