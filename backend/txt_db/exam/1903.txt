Question 
People often have memorable or moving experiences when they explore their country's geography. You might climb a famous mountain or swim at a beautiful beach. Tell me a memorable story of a time when you visited a natural place in your country.

Answer 
I yeah, uh, it's interesting question. I can walk on on the river. You know what I mean? I went to a certain river. It's called 한탄 river. It's in 포천 city in 경기 province. So it's like the Grand Canyon. It's a very small Grand Canyon. You know what I mean? So anyway, the 한탄 river was very, you know, very awesome because it has a walking path along the river and even I can walk on the river. You know what I mean?

Feedback 
The beginning is too long. 'It's interesting question' is grammatically incorrect; it should be 'It's an interesting question'. For beginners (IL/IM1), avoid these light comments as they can make the answer longer and sound prepared. Avoid using 'certain' at the beginner level as it's often used incorrectly; 'this' is a better alternative for past experiences (e.g., 'I went to this river'). When mentioning Korean names, either add 'in Korean' (e.g., 'It's called Han River in Korean') or omit the name and describe it (e.g., 'I went to this river... I forgot the name...'). Avoid unnecessary details like the city and province ('It's in 포천 city in 경기 province') in the beginning; keep the main point clean, especially for beginners. Avoid starting sentences with 'So'; use 'And so' for a smoother transition (Rule Number 3). When comparing, be direct (e.g., 'But it's very small' instead of 'It's a very small Grand Canyon. You know what I mean?'). Practice filler phrases like 'You know what I mean?' (Rule Number 4). Use 'And so anyway' instead of 'So anyway'. For past experiences, use past tense consistently ('it had a walking path' instead of 'it has a walking path'). If using difficult words like 'promenade' (for walking path), pair them with easier words or explanations (e.g., 'it had a promenade, you know, a walking path') to ensure understanding even if pronunciation is slightly off (Rule Number 5: Hard plus easy words together). The main point (why the river was awesome - walking path and walking on the river) came out too late (after 1 minute); it should be within the first 30 seconds. Choose only one main reason for the beginning (e.g., the walking path) and discuss other points later in the answer structure (MP plus 2 strategy recommended for beginners).
