Question 
Introduce yourself.

Answer 
Hi, I absolutely love coffee. I can't get enough of it. You know, when I woke up, I drank some coffee. Just before this test, I drank some coffee. And right after the test, I'm sure you can guess what I will do. I am a coffee enthusiast. I am totally addicted to coffee. And you know, that is all you need to know about me.

Feedback 
The introduction question is important for a good first impression. Instead of a standard, boring answer (name, job, etc.), talk about something you like or a hobby (e.g., coffee). The key strategy is to connect this topic from your introduction to your answers for later questions on different topics (like hotels, coffee shops, housing, restaurants). This shows naturalness, control, and conversational skill. Make these connections briefly, only once or twice, not for every question. This approach makes both your introduction and subsequent answers more powerful.
