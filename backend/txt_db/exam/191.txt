Question 
I would like to know where you live. Can you describe your home to me? How many rooms does it have? Give me a description with lots of details.

Answer 
Um if I had to describe my home, I would say it's like a personalized movie theater. Because my home is quite small, but I have a huge monitor at my home. So I love it because I can enjoy a lot of movies at my home alone. Um also there are other rooms like bathroom and bedroom, but there is nothing special about them. And it's surprising how a huge monitor affects of of the concept of my home. Although the huge monitor was quite pricey, but I think it's worth it. So that's the most part I love about my home.

Feedback 
The student's answer attempts to describe their home, focusing on a huge monitor. The structure follows a basic pattern (S, M, A, T). However, there are areas for improvement, particularly for aiming for a higher level like AL.

1.  **S (Main Point):** The opening "it's like a personalized movie theater" uses a simile. While creative, using similes in the main point (S) can make it less simple and clear, which is preferred for the S part. It's better to state the main point directly, e.g., focusing on the computer room or the monitor itself. Similes are better suited for later parts (like A).
2.  **M (Examples):** The student mentions "bathroom and bedroom" but states "there is nothing special about them." This is too simple for the M part, which requires detailed examples. To improve, provide specific examples of what's *in* these rooms, even if they are standard items (e.g., a basic shower, toilet, sink in the bathroom; a bed, desk, closet in the bedroom). This is the "예 예 전략" (example within example).
3.  **A (Additional Details):** The student returns to the huge monitor and mentions it was pricey but worth it. This is good, adding detail. However, the grammar "affects of of the concept" needs correction. Phrases like "blown away" or "mind blowing" could be used here to describe the impact of the monitor.
4.  **R (Realization/Reflection):** The R part is missing. A realization could be about how one specific item (the monitor) can significantly impact the feeling or function of the entire home. Phrases like "It's surprising how much..." or "I realized that..." are good for the R part.
5.  **T (Takeaway/Conclusion):** The conclusion is simple. Starting the conclusion with just "So" is less natural than using transitions like "And so," "Yeah so," "So yeah," "Anyway," or "Anyhow." A stronger concluding phrase like "It wouldn't feel the same without it" or "It wouldn't be the same without it" can make the ending more impactful.

**Overall:** The answer has a clear topic (the monitor) and attempts structure. To reach AL, the student needs to significantly enhance the M part with detailed examples (예 예 전략), include an R part, refine transitions, and use more varied vocabulary and sentence structures (e.g., using 'if', 'stands out', 'blown away', 'worth it'). Practicing segment by segment (S&M, SMA) can help build confidence and detail in each part.
