This is a comparison question. When answering comparison questions, remember the 'opposite contrast' strategy. Start with your main point about the present, then describe the past using opposite characteristics or feelings, and finally return to the present, reinforcing your main point. This shows contrast twice. Only talk about the house itself; discussion about the neighborhood is a separate topic.
