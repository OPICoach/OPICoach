Feedback 
This is a comparison question. Facilities and amenities can be used interchangeably (e.g., swimming pool, golf area), but are different from toiletries (e.g., toothpaste, toothbrush). In the 6/6 strategy, if the second question in a combo set is comparison, the third question is almost always past experience. Use the grace period to prepare your strategy for a past experience question (e.g., include others like friends or family, use direct quotation).
