Feedback 
This is a description question, potentially a '돌발' (unexpected) topic like haircuts. Practice answering within 1 minute. The correct phrasing is 'get a haircut' (not 'get my haircut'). You can skip up to 5 questions in total if you are unable to answer. Instead of 'haircut guy', use 'hair stylist' or 'barber' unless you are intentionally portraying a specific persona (like a gangster).
