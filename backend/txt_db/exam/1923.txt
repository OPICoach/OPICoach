Question 
Tell me a little bit about a country close to your country. Tell me what the country looks like, about its people, and some of its traditions.

Answer 
Alright, so, hmm, a close country to my country. Alright, well, uh, there's China. And, you know what? I'd like to talk about the people in China. I think Chinese people drink a lot. It's amazing. Because they drink a lot. Their traditional liquor is quite strong. It feels really good. Whenever I go to a restaurant in China, there is booze everywhere. And people usually eat with a drink. These foods taste better with their alcohol. Thinking about it again, all traditions seem to be somewhat connected to alcohol. So I think they drink well. Anyway, that's my thought.

Feedback 
This answer follows the instructor's recommendations well. It starts slowly to avoid sounding scripted ('Alright, so, hmm...'). It chooses one country (China) and focuses on one aspect from the question's list (people), specifically their drinking habits. It uses positive language ('amazing', 'feels really good') and incorporates the suggested 'What, Feeling, Why' structure ('Chinese people' - What, 'amazing' - Feeling, 'drink a lot' - Why). The use of 'It's amazing' demonstrates good use of pronouns. Details are provided (traditional liquor, restaurants, eating with drinks) to support the main point. The use of 'Whenever I go...' is appropriate for describing a recurring observation. It avoids negative comments about other people. The conclusion briefly connects back to 'traditions'. The structure is neat and focused, which is key for clear communication in OPIc.
