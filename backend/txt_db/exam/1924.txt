Question 
Tell me what recycling was like when you were a child. Was there a particular place to which you took out the recyclables? Describe what it was like and what you did in detail.

Answer 
Recycling. Hmm. Okay, that's pretty interesting. When I was a child, I would have to say that, you know, recycling was quite organized. I mean, at least in my home anyway. Now that I think more about it, I remember specifically my mother giving me the lowdown on how to recycle. She was like, "Sam, make sure to separate everything!" And then, you know, not before long, it became my full responsibility. It was a little bit annoying at times, but I mean, I had no choice. Anyway, I learned to separate the cans, paper, glass, and plastics, and um, you know, put them in their rightful bins.

Feedback 
This sample answer effectively addresses the past experience question by focusing on a main point (recycling was organized at home) and incorporating feelings (annoying at times). The key tip demonstrated here is the use of a direct quotation ("She was like, 'Sam, make sure to separate everything!'"). Using direct quotations makes the answer more dynamic and natural, helping to achieve a higher score like AL. When quoting someone else, use their name for clarity. When quoting your own thoughts, use phrases like "I thought to myself" or "I was like." Keep direct quotations short, especially when practicing, to minimize grammatical errors. Remember to focus on feelings rather than getting bogged down in excessive details.
