Question 
What is the difference between level, mark, grade, and score in the context of OPIC?

Answer 
They are all pretty much the same thing and are quite interchangeable.

Feedback 
These words (level, mark, grade, score) are essentially synonyms when talking about your OPIC result. You can use any of them, for example: 'What level did you get?' or 'What score did you get?'
