Question 
If I couldn't understand a question, can I just pass that? (혹시 질문을 이해 못 했을 때는 그냥 넘어가도 될까요?)

Answer 
Yes, you can skip questions you do not understand.

Feedback 
If you truly do not understand a question, it is acceptable to skip it. While the goal is to answer all questions, skipping one or even an entire combo set (three questions) is possible and students have still achieved grades like IH by doing so when they were stuck.
