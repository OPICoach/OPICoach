Question 
I used the script you provided about coffee. Can I say it exactly like that in the test? (제가 커피에 대하여 샘이 말하는 거 그대로 썼는데 그거 그대로 시험장 가서 말해도 될까요?)

Answer 
You can use the script, but relying on scripts is not the way to truly improve your English ability.

Feedback 
While it's okay to use the content of a script you've prepared, depending heavily on scripts hinders genuine English improvement. Scripts can guide you, but you need to practice speaking spontaneously. Focus on making the core ideas your own rather than memorizing word-for-word.
