And I really love, I mean, I'm really really crazy at there. Yeah, that's right. There. At there, there are lots of bikini girls, and whenever I go there, I always...

Feedback 
Oh my gosh, this is my question: Good start, shows confidence. Alternative: "This is my type of question." Hands down: Good expression, but requires exaggeration to be used correctly. Incorrect usage sounds awkward and might be misinterpreted by the grader. Beach pronunciation: Be careful with the pronunciation of "beach" (long E) vs. "bitch" (short I). "Bitch" is a swear word. One of my favorite beach: Grammatical error. After "one of", use the plural form, so it should be "beaches". The singular form combined with quick pronunciation might sound like "bitch". Hot beach: The term "Hot beach" sounds awkward and potentially confusing, especially combined with the pronunciation issue and mention of "hot girls". There are lots of hot girls at there: Grammatical error. Remove "at" when using "there". Avoid using prepositions like "in", "at", "on", "to" with "there". I'm really really crazy at there: Another instance of incorrectly using "at there". This simple grammatical mistake is repeated often. Bikini girls: "Bikini girls" might sound slightly awkward. Consider alternative expressions. "Gorgeous girl" can be expressed as "bombshell" (positive meaning in English).
