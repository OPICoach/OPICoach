Question 
Describe the country you visited last time. Which tense should I use, present or past?

Answer 
You should use the past tense.

Feedback 
Even though some initial questions in a topic set might be in the present tense, this specific question asks about a past experience ('visited last time'). Therefore, your entire answer describing that past trip should be structured using past tense verbs. The speaker provides an example answer about visiting Toronto, Canada, focusing on describing the past experience (cold weather, people's actions) using past tense.
