Question 
Tell me about a concert you attended.

Answer 
The concert was awesome. Like it was really awesome. It was my first concert.

Feedback 
This answer follows the S-R-R strategy. 'The concert was awesome' is the simple statement. 'Like it was really awesome' repeats the feeling with a filler ('Like it was') and an intensifier ('really'). 'It was my first concert' gives the reason without using 'because', which is a good variation for showing fluency.
