Question 
Describe a time someone was late.

Answer 
She was late. I mean she was really late. She missed the bus.

Feedback 
This answer uses the S-R-R strategy with a personal pronoun ('She'). 'She was late' is the simple statement. 'I mean she was really late' repeats the idea using the filler 'I mean' and the intensifier 'really'. 'She missed the bus' provides the reason. Using fillers like 'I mean' can make the conversation sound more natural.
