Question 
Tell me about a party you went to.

Answer 
The party was nice. Seriously, it was so nice. I met many friendly people.

Feedback 
This answer applies the S-R-R strategy. 'The party was nice' is the simple statement. 'Seriously, it was so nice' repeats the feeling using the filler 'Seriously' and the intensifier 'so'. 'I met many friendly people' provides the reason, correctly using the past tense ('met') and adding descriptive detail ('friendly'). 'Seriously' is a useful word for beginners.
