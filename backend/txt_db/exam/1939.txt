Question 
Tell me about a movie you watched.

Answer 
The movie was boring. Like it was really boring. It was so long.

Feedback 
This answer uses the S-R-R strategy for a negative feeling. 'The movie was boring' is the simple statement. 'Like it was really boring' repeats the feeling using 'Like it was' and 'really'. 'It was so long' provides the reason. It's okay to speak slowly when using intensifiers like 'really'.
