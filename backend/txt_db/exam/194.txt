Question 
Talk about a problem you had while you were planning a trip. What was the problem and how did you deal with the situation?

Answer 
Okay, so let me think about like trip. Uh okay, I'm just thinking about like travel with my family. Uh normally my travel style is like no plan. Just go and spend money, spend time. Just easy, easy going. But my mom and father, my my my my mother and father they really like uh they they like to well prepared trip. So they need to check the like the how can I say? Trip schedule, trip schedule. So that can be the like problem for trip. You understand what I mean? Hey, you know how I feel awkward now in this like cafe? There's even there's some people. Finished? No, I'm not finished. So uh normally my parents ask me to make a plan for travel. But I feel really lazy about making that. But yeah, for the good trip I try to ask my brother to make the travel even my brother don't go will not go to the travel. Because my brother like to make a plan. So I got plan from my brother and then can solve the our trip. And then I followed my brother's trip maybe yeah and then can enjoy our family trip. That's it.

Feedback 
Here, 'let me think about like trip' is grammatically incorrect, though it shows understanding of the question. Saying 'my past trip experiences' or 'Let's see' would be clearer. 'travel with my family' is awkward; try 'My family and I went to so many places' or 'My family and I traveled quite a bit'. Using 'normally' is good, but repeating it later shows limited vocabulary; use alternatives like 'usually', 'frequently', 'always', 'almost always'. 'my travel style is like no plan' is clear. In 'Just go and spend money, spend time. Just easy, easy going', the use of 'just' is good. 'spend time' is awkward without specifying with whom (e.g., 'with my family'). 'easy going' is better used for people, not situations. Repeating 'my' five times ('my mom and father, my my my my mother and father') is excessive; pause after the first 'my' and then repeat 'my mother'. Avoid over-correcting grammar during the test. 'they like to well prepared trip' is awkward; 'well' is used incorrectly. Try 'thorough' instead: 'They like to be thorough when preparing for trips' or 'They're always so thorough whenever they prepare for trips'. Repeating 'trip schedule' shows a lack of communication flow. 'how can I say?' is overused by students; try 'what do you call it?' or 'what am I trying to say?'. Addressing the problem ('So that can be the like problem for trip') comes too late in the answer. Talking to the examiner ('You understand what I mean? Hey, you know how I feel awkward now in this like cafe?') is acceptable briefly but was too long here. The story becomes confusing and contradictory: first parents are thorough planners, then they ask you to plan, then you ask your brother. This shows a lack of a clear main point and makes the answer feel forced and difficult to follow. Avoid making the answer longer just because you lack content; focus on clarity and a single, clear narrative.
