Question 
Describe a time someone was late.

Answer 
She was late. Really late. She missed the bus.

Feedback 
This answer uses a variation of the S-R-R strategy. 'She was late' is the simple statement. 'Really late' repeats the idea directly with the intensifier 'really'. 'She missed the bus' provides the reason using the past tense. Using 'really' more often is recommended.
