Question 
Describe your country's geography for me. Are there mountains, lakes or rivers? What is your country like?

Answer 
Um, actually, the 70% of our country is a mountain. So our country is is very famous for mountains, especially for old mountains. And the and the ground has been so old and I think people really like to go mountain because it has a really beautiful view. Mostly uh in terms of like rocks because there are so many old rocks in my country so not only um our domestic people but foreigners are really love to go there um including like um like um Halla um mountain and Jeju Island and as and yeah, so many people really love to uh go there because of the reason and I just love to uh go there just thinking about it.

Feedback 
Again, starting with 'um, actually' is a pattern to be mindful of. The main point (70% mountains, famous for old mountains) is stated clearly at the beginning. Providing details like the age of the ground/rocks and the beautiful view is good. Mentioning specific examples like Hallasan and Jeju Island adds concrete detail. The overall structure follows the main point -> details -> conclusion pattern well. The language is generally clear and understandable.
