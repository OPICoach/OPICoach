Feedback 
The initial reaction ('I didn't expect this question') and thinking pause are natural. There was a clear misunderstanding of 'movies with adults' (intended as watching movies *with* adult companions) as 'adult movies'. Despite the misunderstanding, the answer maintained flow and included personal feelings ('makes me excited'). The humorous and confident explanation based on the misunderstanding ('I'm an adult, I'm a man, it's normal') is very human and engaging, which can be positively received by graders looking for personality and natural speech, even if the content is unexpected. While the content wasn't what the question intended, the delivery showed fluency and the ability to express personal thoughts and feelings.
