Question 
Can you describe a typical day or routine for a bartender? What do they usually do from the beginning to the end of their shift?

Answer 
Okay, so a typical day for bartender is very busy. They have many things to do. First, they prepare the bar area, like cutting fruits and checking stocks. Then, during the shift, they make drinks for customers. They also need to be friendly and talk to people. Sometimes customers are difficult or unreasonable, but bartenders must stay calm and not get angry. They also clean the bar area constantly. At the end of the day, they clean everything very well and count the money. It's a hard job.

Feedback 
Okay, this is a good start! You've covered the main points of a bartender's routine. Let's refine it for a higher OPIc score.  Instead of 'a typical day for bartender is very busy', try 'The way I see it, a typical day for a bartender is very busy.' Adding 'The way I see it' and 'I believe' (as you did later with 'bartenders must') makes your opinion sound more natural and adds complexity.  'They have many things to do' is okay, but you could say 'They have a lot of responsibilities' or 'They are responsible for many things' to use slightly more formal vocabulary.  'First, they prepare the bar area, like cutting fruits and checking stocks.' - Good specific examples! You could add 'and what have you' after 'checking stocks' to show you know there are other tasks, like '...checking stocks, and what have you.'  'Then, during the shift, they make drinks for customers.' - Clear and direct.  'They also need to be friendly and talk to people.' - Good point about customer interaction.  'Sometimes customers are difficult or unreasonable, but bartenders must stay calm and not get angry.' - Excellent! You used 'unreasonable' and the concept of staying calm. You could vary the phrase 'stay calm' with 'remain calm' or 'not lose their cool' for more dynamic language.  'They also clean the bar area constantly.' - Good use of 'constantly' to show ongoing action.  'At the end of the day, they clean everything very well and count the money.' - Good description of closing duties. 'It's a hard job.' - Simple but effective concluding statement.  Overall, your answer is clear and addresses the prompt. To improve, focus on using introductory phrases like 'The way I see it,' varying your vocabulary (e.g., 'remain calm,' 'not lose their cool'), and perhaps structuring your answer more explicitly with a main point (like their specific role of staying calm), then examples of their duties, and then returning to the main point about handling difficult situations. Keep practicing!
