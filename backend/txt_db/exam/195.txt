Question 
Have you ever borrowed money from someone?

Answer 
Oh my god. Yes. Just a few days ago I borrowed some money from my brother. Well, I'll tell you what, I really afraid when I borrowed some money from him because I already borrowed lots of money from him in this month, but I didn't have any choice because my smartphone was broken. Well, I mean the screen was totally cracked, so I couldn't do anything with my smartphone. So that's why I needed a lot of money at the time. And you know, to be honest, I didn't have any confidence to tell the truth to my mom that I broke my smartphone again. And well, well, it is really scary for me. Wow, I didn't want to imagine anymore. Uh but anyway, even though my brother got a little bit angry at the time, but he borrowed some money from me and I promised I will give I will give the money back till next month. But you know, I really hope that he forget everything to take the money from me.

Feedback 
The student's answer received 4 out of 5 points in the 5W category because the 'where' element was missing. To improve, the student should include the location (where) to make the answer clearer and stronger. The feedback suggests thinking about 'primary where' (physical location) and 'secondary where' (related to 'why' or 'how'). For example, when mentioning breaking the smartphone (the 'how'), the secondary where could be the floor, leading to the primary where being at home. Adding such details enhances the answer.
