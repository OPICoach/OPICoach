Question 
You indicated in the survey that you listen to music. What kinds of music do you listen to? Who are some of your favorite musicians or composers?

Answer 
Well, I do like listening to all kinds of music. My favorite genre is, I think, jazz because I think it makes me feel comforted whenever I listen to that music. You know, there are lots of jazz musicians like Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Sarah Vaughan, and so on. But especially I like Billie Holiday. I guess you might have heard her song, like I'm a fool to want you.
