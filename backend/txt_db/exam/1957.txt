Question 
Tell me about the weather at where you live. How are the seasons? What is the weather like in each season? Which season do you personally like?

Answer 
Well, actually, in South Korea, we have a four season, but I feel like, you know, I feel like I live in Korea. I thought just we have only two season, winter and summer, because summer is so hot and winter is so cold. But among them, my favorite season is winter because, you know, I'm so sweat person. So, I don't like I hate summer. So, I even though that was freaking so cold, I I I love cold in winter.

Feedback 
Mentioning you live in Korea is good. You got to the main point (favorite season is winter) relatively quickly (13 seconds). Instead of 'among them', try smoother transitions like 'But you know what?' before stating your favorite season. 'I'm a sweat person' is awkward; 'I'm a winter person' or 'I don't like sweating' is better. Your speed and intonation were nice, and you used fillers well.
