Question 
How is the weather today at where you are? Is it cold or warm? Talk about today's weather in detail.

Answer 
Oh my god, today was so so horrible because, you know, today was so freaking out among the winter, particularly today. You know, when I was so used um in the morning, oh my god, I don't want to go outside, but I have to go outside. But, you know, actually in Korea these days, I think every day is cold. I don't know why. Maybe global warming. I I don't know. But anyway, these days was so cold.

Feedback 
This question is about today's weather. You said you love winter in the previous answer, but here you say today's winter is 'horrible' and 'freaking cold', creating a confusing message. You need a smooth transition to connect the two, acknowledging your preference but explaining why today is different. For example, 'Even though I love cold weather, today is just way too cold. I don't like it this cold.'
