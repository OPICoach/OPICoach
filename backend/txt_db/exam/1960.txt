Question 
Severe weather conditions can do a lot of damage. Tell me about an experience you had related to severe weather conditions. Perhaps a city was flooded, or maybe businesses or schools closed due to heavy snow. What was the problem? How did you deal with the situation? Give me all the details about that experience.

Answer 
Well, I think I have a one I I have about one time that is when I was in elementary school days. Where, you know, as usually, I just go school. But that during that time, uh that day was like, you know, freaking so much snow that day. So, oh my god, it's like, oh my god, what's happening? What should I do? But um but I don't know why. But, you know, I I I can't deal with that because just nature uh nature thing, so I just go school. Um

Feedback 
You need a crystal clear main point at the beginning for a past experience question. State what the story is about and if it was a good or bad experience. Also, a basic grammar point for past experience is 'when I was in my elementary school days'. The 'my' is very important.
