Question 
Describe the picture you see.

Answer 
I think this is a picture taken in a park. There are two women in this picture. Let me describe a woman on the right hand side first. She has short blonde hair and she is wearing a white shirt and blue jeans. On the left side of the picture, I can see another woman who is wearing a striped dress and white shoes. Both of the women are sitting on a bench with their legs crossed. They are looking at each other and smiling. In the background of the picture, I can see a lot of green trees. I think this picture was taken either in late spring or early summer.

Feedback 
This answer provides a good description of the picture, covering the location, the people, their appearance, posture, interaction, and the background. The description is well-organized (describing right, then left, then background). To provide specific feedback on sentence structure, vocabulary usage, and fluency, the spoken response would be needed.
