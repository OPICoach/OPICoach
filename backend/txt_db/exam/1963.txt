Question 
Tell me about your experience eating out. When was the last time you ate out? What kind of restaurants do you usually go to? What are the advantages of eating out?

Answer 
The last time I ate out was two days ago. I had pasta for dinner at one of my favorite restaurants and it was delicious. I ate out almost every day. When I eat out, I go to many different places such as Chinese, Italian, and of course Korean restaurants. There are some advantages of eating out. First, I can save some time and energy. If I cook at home, I have to do some grocery shopping, prepare a meal and do the dishes afterwards. However, if I ate out, I don't have to worry about any of these. And also, if I ate out, I can try new food. Since I'm not a good cook, well, eating out is a better option for me if I want to try something new and delicious.
