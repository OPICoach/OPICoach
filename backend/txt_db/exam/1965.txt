Question 
You received a message from David about a problem promoting the dance class. Call David back, acknowledge the problem, explain what you've tried, and suggest a couple of solutions.

Answer 
Hi David, this is Sunny. I just got your message saying that we have a problem promoting our school's dance class. The thing is, we already tried an advertisement in the local newspaper, but it didn't work out. After looking into the matter, I've come up with a couple of solutions. First of all, why don't we place an advertisement on the social media such as Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram? Well, more and more people these days are using these social networking sites, so it might be effective. In addition, how about making some flyers and passing them out at nearby universities? By doing so, we might be able to attract more college students to our dance program. Anyway, if you have any questions about my suggestions, please call me back. Bye.

Feedback 
This answer effectively handles the role-play scenario. It adopts an appropriate tone for a phone call, acknowledges the problem, explains the previous unsuccessful attempt, and proposes two relevant and distinct solutions. The structure is logical and easy to follow. To provide specific feedback on sentence structure, vocabulary usage, and fluency, the spoken response would be needed.
