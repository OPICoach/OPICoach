Question 
Do you agree or disagree that it's better to shop online than in a physical store? Explain your reasons.

Answer 
I agree that when buying products, it's better to shop for them online than in a store. Well, there are several reasons to support my opinion. The most important reason is that, well, shopping online is very convenient because we can buy products anytime. Well, last weekend, I bought some groceries from an online store at 10:30 in the evening, but I got the items the very next morning. It was very convenient. And in addition, if we buy products from an online store, we can usually save some money. Well, online shopping malls offer products at a lower price compared to, well, offline stores. So, that's why I bought my, well, laptop computer from an online store and at that time I was able to save around $300. For these reasons, I strongly agree with the statement that it is better to shop for products online.

Feedback 
This answer clearly states an opinion and provides strong support with two main reasons (convenience and saving money), each illustrated with a personal example. The use of transition phrases helps connect the ideas. To provide specific feedback on sentence structure, vocabulary usage, and fluency, the spoken response would be needed.
