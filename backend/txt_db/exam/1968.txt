Question 
Share an experience from one of your past relationships that made you angry or upset.

Answer 
Initially, I claimed I had no such experiences and was 'single since birth' (모솔). After further prompting, I shared an experience where a past boyfriend suddenly disappeared or 'ghosted' me without explanation. This made me angry after the breakup. I also discussed how I would react if he contacted me again (ignore him, but feel internal curiosity/temptation) and my belief that someone who leaves once might do so again.

Feedback 
The instructor provided alternative English phrases for my Korean responses, such as: 'I've been single since birth' (모솔이에요), 'Oh, it's endless. I don't know where to start' (너무 많아 가지고 이게 어떤 걸 얘기해야 될까?), 'He pulled a Houdini' (잠적했어), 'The fact that we broke up for no apparent reason pisses me off' (이유 없이 헤어진 건 화가 나), 'It was obvious he wanted to end it right there and then' (이 관계를 끝내고 싶었던 거잖아), 'I wouldn't respond' (무시하지), 'I'd be tempted. Not gonna lie' (속으로는 흔들려), 'If he did it once, who's to say he wouldn't do it again?' (그렇게 떠난 사람은 또 떠날 수 있다고 생각해), 'Ultimately, I wouldn't accept' (난 노라고 할 거야), and 'I could end up regretting it. Who knows?' (후회할 수도 있어).
