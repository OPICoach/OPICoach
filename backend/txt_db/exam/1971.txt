Question 
How is the weather today at where you are? Is it cold or warm? Talk about today's weather in detail.

Answer 
Well, actually, um, it's raining outside, but you know, I hate rain, 'cause it made me, um, I mean, it is so humid, and it made me so sticky, right? Um, which is, um, which is what I really hate it is, um, the sticky.

Feedback 
The opening with 'Well, actually, um' and mentioning the rain is good, showing thinking time and addressing the question directly. Using 'actually' mid-sentence is generally smoother than at the start. 'Cause' for 'because' is good for faster speech. However, 'made me' should be 'makes me' when talking about a general effect. The restart with 'I mean' is an effective filler for correcting or restarting. Stating it's 'humid' after rain might need more explanation as it's not always obvious. The repetition of 'sticky' at the end is ineffective; it sounds hesitant and like the speaker ran out of ideas, rather than for emphasis. The grammar in the final part ('which is what I really hate it is the sticky') is awkward. Instead of repeating 'sticky', explain *why* being sticky is disliked or elaborate on the feeling to deepen the answer and show AL-level thinking.
