Question 
I would like to know about where you live, talk about the different rooms at your place. Tell me about your favorite room in your home. What does it look like?

Answer 
All right, so I live in apartment with my parents. And there are three bedrooms. You know, my favorite room is just my room. Well, there are everything. So it makes me feel cozy. I also like kitchen and living room. But it isn't cozy than my room because that place is used to other people like parents, you know, so that's why I love my room because the room is able to me only. So that's why I love my room. So cozy and private is important to me.

Feedback 
General Feedback: Energy level is too low. Need to boost energy and sound more engaged. Be specific (짚어) instead of general (e.g., 'big' house vs. 'big kitchen'). Practice the SM strategy (Start with Main point, give Examples).

Specific Feedback:
- "All right, so": Good start, nice transition. Practice pronunciation of "all right" (not 올라이트).
- "in apartment": Should be "in an apartment". Practice pronunciation of "apartment" (mint sound).
- "parents": Practice pronunciation (not parents, but parents).
- "And there are three bedrooms": Good use of "and" as a transition/filler. Good use of "there are". Suggestion: Use "we have" for better connection to "with my parents".
- "You know, my favorite room is just my room": Suggestion: Use "among them" for smoother transition. Suggestion: Use "my own room". "Absolutely" could replace "just".
- "there are everything": Grammatically incorrect. Should be "there is everything". Suggestion: "it has everything I need" or "it has everything that I need".
- "So it makes me feel cozy": Suggestion: Use "and so" or "which". Practice the pattern "which makes it a cozy room".
- "I also like kitchen and living room": Should be "my kitchen" or "our kitchen/living room". Practice pronunciation of "our" (R sound). Suggestion for transition: "Of course, we have other spaces that I love for different reasons" or "At the same time, we have other spaces that I love for different reasons".
- "it isn't cozy than my room": Grammatically incorrect comparison. Should be "not as cozy as" or "less cozy than".
- "that place is used to other people": Awkward phrasing. Suggestion: "that place is used by other people" or "other people use that space".
- "the room is able to me only": Grammatically incorrect/awkward. Suggestion: "It's my own private space", "It's a space just for me", "it's my personal space where I can relax".
- "So that's why I love my room": Good conclusion start. Suggestion: Add "the best" or similar words (favorite, most) to reinforce the answer to the question.
