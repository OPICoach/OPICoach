Feedback 
The student's answer directly addresses the question about grammar being boring or fun. The use of phrases like 'super boring', 'extremely boring', 'so boring', and 'too boring' effectively conveys the student's strong negative feeling towards grammar. The repetition emphasizes the point. The phrase 'Look at this, look at the wonderful English here, right?' seems sarcastic, implying the opposite of wonderful, which adds to the expression of boredom or dislike. The final 'I like that' is contradictory to the preceding statements and seems out of place in expressing boredom; it might be a conversational filler or indicate a different sentiment not clearly expressed.
