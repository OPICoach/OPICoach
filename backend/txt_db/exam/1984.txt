Question 
Talk about your favorite takeout or delivery food restaurant. What is the place like? What kinds of food do they commonly offer?

Answer 
I liked the Chinese restaurant nearby my home because this place delivers every food that I want in within 5 minutes. So, I think I found this very fascinating and I that's why I try to always use this restaurant. When I found this uh uh the ones, I was shocked by a speed of their delivery. It's just like a thunderstorm. Boom, boom, boom. You know, when I hang up, hang up the call, sometimes they delivered my food in 3 minutes. It's so it's like a literally thunder and then that's why I was shocked by the speed of delivery. So Yeah, you know, I'm my mouth is watering while talking. So I probably need order some food uh uh after this class, but somehow, yeah, I I think that's that's why I liked this place so much.

Feedback 
The question asks for a description (묘사), so use the present tense instead of 'I liked'. Starting with 'There's a Chinese restaurant...' is a good approach. Enhance the description of speed using LY words like 'incredibly fast delivery service'. Instead of 'within 5 minutes', consider a specific time like '15 minutes tops' and use the pattern 'When I say fast, I mean...'. 'Fascinating' is a good word, similar to amazing or incredible. Change 'thunderstorm' to 'lightning strike' as it better conveys speed. The 'Boom, boom, boom' is a good sound effect (효과음) but can be integrated more smoothly. The exaggeration 'Sometimes I hang up and my food's already there' is good, but in the actual test, saying 'after this class' is awkward; use 'after this test' or similar. To improve structure and score (SMA strategy): S (Start with MP): Begin with the main point, like the fast delivery. M (Mention examples): Use transition words like 'As for their food' or 'And of course' to talk about other aspects, like the food selection. Give 2 examples (e.g., 짜장면, spring rolls) and use descriptive words like 'fantastic selection' or 'addictive'. A (Address importance of MP): Use a transition like 'But even though their food is great' to return to and emphasize the main point (delivery speed). Use comparisons like 'It's like a lightning strike'. After an exaggeration, clarify it's an exaggeration with a phrase like 'Well, it feels like that anyway'. End with a strong feeling using an LY word, e.g., 'It's truly amazing'. Incorporating sound effects and showing energy makes the answer sound more human and less like a script.
