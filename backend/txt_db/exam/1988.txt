Question 
Level 3/4: General strategy for questions 14 and 15.

Answer 
Always start with phrases showing interest like "That's interesting" or "That's an interesting question where to begin." For question 15, reuse questions heard in question 14. End by suggesting meeting up.

Feedback 
Starting with phrases like "That's interesting" shows engagement and buys time. Reusing questions from Q14 makes it easier to formulate relevant questions in Q15. Suggesting a meeting provides a natural and conversational closing, which is good for the role-play aspect.
