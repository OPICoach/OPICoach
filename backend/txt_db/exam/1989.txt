Question 
Level 3/4: Ask 3-4 questions about the other person's house (e.g., "I live in the USA. Ask me three or four questions about my house.").

Answer 
"Oh, that's an interesting question. Where to begin? About the location, where is it located? What does it look like? Do you live alone or do you live with your family? I'm wondering about your favorite room. What is it? Why do you like it? How much do you like it? That's good to know. We should meet up sometime."

Feedback 
Using "That's an interesting question" is a good opener. Reusing common descriptive questions from Q14 (location, appearance, living situation) is effective. "I'm wondering about..." is a useful phrase for asking more specific questions. Acknowledging the response ("That's good to know") and suggesting a meeting provides a good structure and closing.
