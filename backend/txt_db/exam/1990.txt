Question 
Level 3/4: Ask 3-4 questions about the other person's cafe (e.g., "I work at a cafe. Ask me three or four questions.").

Answer 
"Oh, that's an interesting question. Where to begin? About the location of your cafe, where is it located? What does it look like? Do you work alone or do you work with other staff? I'm wondering about your favorite drink. What is it? Why do you like it? How much do you like it? That's good to hear. We should meet up sometime whenever it is convenient for you."

Feedback 
Similar to the house topic, starting with an engaging phrase is good. Asking about location, appearance, and colleagues reuses common descriptive question types. Asking about a favorite drink using "I'm wondering about..." is a good specific question. Using acknowledgments and suggesting a meeting helps structure the response effectively.
