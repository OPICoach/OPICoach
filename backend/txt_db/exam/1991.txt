Question 
Level 3/4: Ask 3-4 questions about the other person's hobby (e.g., "I like jogging too. Ask me three or four questions about my jogging.").

Answer 
"Oh, that's an interesting question. I didn't know you like jogging. Can you tell me about your jogging place? What does it look like? How often do you go there? Where is it located? Do you go there alone or with your friends? I'm wondering about your favorite park. Why do you like it? How much do you like it? That sounds great. We should meet up sometime for jogging. When are you available?"

Feedback 
Expressing surprise ("I didn't know...") is a good way to start. Reusing questions from Q14 (place, frequency, who with) is an effective strategy. Asking about a favorite place using "I'm wondering about..." adds detail. Suggesting meeting up for the specific hobby provides a natural and relevant closing.
