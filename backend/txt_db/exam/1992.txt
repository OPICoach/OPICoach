Question 
Level 5/6: Describe a recent issue related to a survey topic (e.g., movies, jogging, technology).

Answer 
"I haven't had a chance to [activity] recently due to the coronavirus outbreak. I feel frustrated that so many people are suffering from the pandemic including me. This virus is highly contagious and more infectious than anything else. So I have nothing but staying home, goofing around. I really feel like [activity]. It is such a shame that I can't do that anymore even though I really want to. The virus is spreading widely throughout the world. I hope things get better soon so that I can do [activity] back again. I can't wait for the moment."

Feedback 
This script is highly recommended because it is versatile and can be adapted to almost any topic by changing "[activity]". It uses advanced vocabulary and expressions (frustrated, suffering from the pandemic, highly contagious, infectious, nothing but staying home, goofing around, such a shame, spreading widely, can't wait for the moment), which are suitable for higher levels (IM3+ aiming for IH/AL). It effectively addresses the "recent issue" aspect by focusing on the impact of the pandemic.
