Feedback 
These are essential grammatical structures and phrases for effectively discussing similarities, differences, and changes, which are key requirements for higher OPIc levels (IH/AL). Using "There are so many similarities..." helps introduce comparisons. "There have been changes" is the core phrase for describing change, and variations like "little" or "noticeable" add nuance. "One of the biggest changes would be..." helps highlight significant points.
