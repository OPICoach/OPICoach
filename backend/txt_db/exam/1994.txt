Question 
Tell me about yourself.

Answer 
I tend to make people feel comfortable when they are with me. And I'm also a good listener as well. Everyone likes to talk about themselves. So when you are a good listener, people will like you. I like sports that I can do with other people. Last Saturday, my friends and I went bowling. I'm not really good at bowling, but I just like the atmosphere of the place. It was a lot of fun, and I had such a great time.

Feedback 
Focus on linking sentences smoothly for fluency. Practice in three stages: content familiarity, sound practice (pronunciation, linking sounds like tend to -> ten to, with me, will -> ìš¸, sports, Last Saturday, liked the), and linking ideas. Pay attention to usage like 'as well' for listing, 'themselves' with 'everyone', 'be good/poor at', 'atmosphere', 'a lot of fun', and 'such a great time' for emphasis. Practice recalling the next sentence based on the previous one's meaning.
