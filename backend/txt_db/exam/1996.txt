Question 
I would like to know where you live. Describe your house in detail.

Answer 
Speaking about my apartment, I live in a high rise apartment in a balcony overlooking the Han River, which is the major river in Seoul, South Korea. Well, it is really spacious and cozy. And it has the two bedroom and one bathroom. Well, speaking of that, there is also a utility room where you can wash, dry your laundry and something like and so on. Well, there are your home appliances that you can think of here and there like everywhere. Well, you know I love to live because I can always get enough rest when I'm at home. That's it. 아, I think my home is the best place and there is nothing like home. 뭐 이런 거 아닐까요?
