Question 
Tell me about yourself.

Answer 
Yes, I was born and raised in Seattle and I moved to Korea about 12 years ago and I've been kind of you know doing my music thing over there for about 10 years now. My parents were both born in Korea and they moved to Seattle when they were I think in their 20s. They met in Seattle and then they had me in Seattle.

This answer effectively uses several key phrases for self-introduction and background. 'Born and raised in [place]' is perfect for stating where you grew up. 'Moved to [place] about [time] ago' clearly indicates a relocation. 'I've been doing my [activity/job] thing for about [time] now' uses the present perfect continuous (have been + ing), which is excellent for describing activities or jobs you've been doing continuously for a period. This tense is very useful for hobbies or work experience ('I've been jogging', 'I've been studying English', 'I've been working at ABC company'). The pronunciation tip about reducing 'have been' to 'I've been' or even 'I been' is helpful for sounding natural. For talking about parents, 'They were both born in [place]' and 'moved to [place] when they were in their [age group, e.g., 20s]' are clear ways to explain their origins and migration. Finally, 'They met in [place] and had me in [place]' is a good structure for mentioning where your parents met and where you were born. Remember you can express the time of moving using 'about X years ago', 'when I was young', or 'when I was in [school level]'. For parents' move, you can use 'about X years ago', 'when they were young', or 'when they were in their [age group]'. You can also use 'We've been living there since then' to indicate staying in a place since a certain time.
