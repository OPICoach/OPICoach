Feedback 
The phrase "As far as I remember, I went to the bank" is a good start. You could also say "As far as I could remember". The part "maybe to wrong" is unclear; it sounds like "maybe to loan". It should be grammatically corrected to "maybe to get a loan". Using "maybe" can create a rhetorical question effect, which is good for communication. The "Yeah" shows a natural, human reaction, which is good. Instead of "forgot to get my ID card", use "forgot to bring my ID card". A better word than "ID card" in this context is "credentials" (e.g., passport, driver's license). "I was very embarrassed" is okay, but be aware that "embarrassed" means "쪽팔리다", not "당황하다". Better expressions for feeling foolish include "I felt so stupid", "I felt like a fool", "I felt so dumb", or "I felt like an idiot". "freak out" is a good expression, meaning you didn't know what to do. The strategy of asking "what am I supposed to do?" is good, but since it's a past experience, the tense should be past: "what was I supposed to do?". The answer was cut off after "I was going back to my house and".
