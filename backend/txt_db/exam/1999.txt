Feedback 
The answer is a good start for a past experience question, especially one involving a problem and solution. The phrase 'as far as I remember' is a natural and good opener. However, there are areas for improvement in grammar, vocabulary, tense, and overall structure for higher OPIc levels (like IH or AR). Specific feedback: 1. 'maybe to loan' should be 'maybe to get a loan'. 'Get a loan' is the correct phrase for receiving a loan. 2. 'forgot to get my ID card' could be improved. 'Forgot to bring my ID card' is more natural. Also, consider using 'credentials' instead of 'ID card' as it's a more sophisticated term that can encompass various forms of identification (passport, driver's license, etc.). 3. 'embarrassed' is correct but often confused with '당황하다' (shocked/surprised). 'Embarrassed' means '쪽팔리다' or '부끄럽다'. For a more natural and impactful expression, consider using phrases like 'I felt so stupid', 'I felt so dumb', 'I felt like a fool', or 'I felt like an idiot'. These are common and effective. 4. 'I freaked out' is a good, natural expression for feeling overwhelmed or not knowing what to do. 5. 'what am I supposed to do' is incorrect tense for a past event. It should be 'what was I supposed to do'. Using the past tense ('was') is crucial here. 6. The answer was cut off, but for problem/solution questions, two structural approaches were discussed: A) Start with the problem, then body (steps 1, 2, 3), then conclusion (solution). B) Start with the solution (MP), then body (details of the problem), then conclusion. Method B (starting with the solution) is often easier for students to make clear and impactful. Example structure for B: Start with the solution/main point (e.g., 'I had to go back home to get my credentials, which meant I went to the bank twice that day, but I got everything done'). Then, elaborate on the problem in the body (e.g., 'It's funny, I felt so dumb that day... I always bring my ID but not that day... I waited so long... then realized I had nothing...'). 7. Incorporating natural reactions ('yeah') and even slight laughter or hesitation can make the answer sound more human and less robotic. 8. Using repetition strategically (e.g., saying 'twice' multiple times for emphasis) can be effective. 9. For higher grades (especially AR), try using 'mixed emotions' (e.g., 'It sucked, but I was happy'). This shows a deeper level of communication and reflection. 10. Simple expressions like 'It's funny' can add naturalness. 11. Conclusions for past experiences should ideally be unique or humorous, leaving a lasting impression, rather than just a general summary.
