Question 
Step 2: Ask your first question.

Answer 
but um I have um not much money, so I want to ask um how much is the iPhone 10?

Feedback 
Good detail ('I don't have much money'), but the context (asking for the most expensive phone with a low budget) is a little awkward. If uncomfortable with extra details, just ask directly: 'How much is it?'. This is the first core question.
