Question 
Talk about unexpected experience while cooking. What was the problem? What did you do wrong? What did you do?

Answer 
Although my number one hobby is cooking, there were some unexpected experiences. I will tell you about this one incident that happened last year. It was when I planned to cook for my boyfriend's 27th birthday. I wanted to do the best for my boyfriend. So my original plan was to make a chocolate cake. But the thing is, it was my first time actually baking. I searched information online, read every single line of it to be fully prepared. This process helped me draw specific plans. But as soon as I started baking, I was in a panic. I set the temperature too high and missed the timing to turn off the oven. As a result, the cake was burnt. I couldn't give it to him, right? One good thing is I had a gift basket prepared. I was so worn out at the end of the day. Since then, my baking skills have improved day by day. And now, making a chocolate cake is like a walk in the park for me. Any other questions?

이 질문은 요리 중 '예상치 못했던 경험'에 대해 묻는 것으로, 과거 시제를 사용해야 합니다. AL 레벨 답변 스크립트로, 더 길고 '근사한 표현(fancy expression)'을 많이 사용합니다. 부사구나 부사절이 문장 앞에 오면 억양을 올려줍니다(Although my number one hobby is cooking↑). 사고(accident)와 사건(incident)의 차이를 구분하여 incident를 사용합니다. 계획(planned to, original plan)과 실제 상황(the thing is, actually baking)을 대조하여 설명합니다. 준비 과정(searched information online, read every single line of it, to be fully prepared, draw specific plans)을 구체적으로 묘사합니다. 문제 상황을 생생하게 전달합니다: I was in a panic, set the temperature too high, missed the timing, as a result, the cake was burnt. 결과와 그 후의 상황(gift basket, I was so worn out)을 덧붙입니다. 'worn out'은 '정말 피곤했다'는 의미의 좋은 표현입니다. 경험을 통해 얻은 변화(Since then, my baking skills have improved day by day)를 현재 완료 시제로 표현합니다. 현재는 쉬운 일이라는 것을 'like a walk in the park'과 같은 관용구로 표현합니다. 발음 연습(wanted to)과 함께 녹음하여 과거 시제 사용이 틀리지 않았는지 확인하는 것이 중요합니다. 경험 이야기의 흐름(왜 요리했는지, 언제, 무엇을, 문제, 결과, 결론)을 잘 구성합니다.
