Question 
Tell me what recycling was like when you were a child starting right away. Was there a particular place to bring the recyclable? Did you have special containers? Describe what it was like and what you did in detail.

Answer 
뭐 사실 제가 어렸을 때 있잖아요. 너무너무 쉬웠어요. 왜냐하면은 제가 아무것도 안 했고 우리 아버님이 다 했습니다. 너무 깔끔하고 너무 좋았어요. 자, 제가 좀 더 설명할게요. 어렸을 때는 제가 그냥 뭐 공부하고 놀고 뭐 재활용도 해야 됐었지만 근데 우리 아버님이 제가 너무 어리다고 아버님이 다 한다고 말을 했어요. 그러면 제가 그거를 거절합니까? 거절 안 했어요. 왜? 좋은 아들이니까. 네, 그렇죠? 그러니까는 제가 그냥 아 아빠 그러면 다 해. 나는 너무 좋아지고 싶은데 그냥 아빠가 다 해 하면서 약간 애교를 뿌리면서 아빠가 그냥 너무 좋은 아빠였어요. 천사였어요. 다 해 줬습니다. 그러니까 제가 그냥 너무 쉽게 말로만 재활용을 다 했어요. 어 아빠 재활용 이거 다 해야 될 것 같 분리 수거 다 해야 될 것 같아. 그럼 아빠가 진짜 약간 이 이 단어가 있죠. 매직 매직 처럼 그냥 없애게 하더라고요. 너무 좋았습니다. 요즘에는 이제 우리 아빠하고 같이 안 사니 제가 다 해야 되네요. 슬픈 인생이 됐습니다. 오 슬퍼. 끝.

Starting phrases like "사실 어렸을 때 있잖아요": Instead of just "Actually" (IH level), use "Well, you know what?", "To tell you the truth", "Honestly", "To be honest" (AL level). Starting with "Well, actually" is better than just "Actually". "제가 어렸을 때 있잖아요": Can be "when I was just a kid", "back in the days", "when I was young". Adding "very" (e.g., "when I was very young") makes it longer and sounds more skilled. Using "little brat" is a slang alternative to "naughty child". Avoid "naughty" as it can have sexual connotations. "너무너무 쉬웠어요": Instead of just "It was so easy" (good), use "It was so so easy", "It was super easy", "It was super super easy", "It was super duper easy". Emphasize the feeling. "왜냐하면은 제가 아무것도 안 했고 우리 아버님이 다 했습니다": Common student answer is stiff ("Because I didn't do anything, my father did everything"). Improve by breaking it down and adding detail/fillers. Example: "It was easy because... well, you know, my father, right? My father... like he he did everything. I mean literally everything. Everything. It was so easy. It was so darn easy. I did absolutely nothing. Yeah. Nothing." Grammar point: "did the recycling" or "took out the recycling". Need "the" before "recycling" when used as a noun like this. "recycled" is also possible. General Strategy: Learn to "break things down" like cutting 돈가스 (pork cutlet). Don't deliver long sentences all at once. Cut it into smaller pieces ("one piece, two piece, three piece"). This makes it sound less stiff, improves organization, gives you time to think, and is easier for the listener. "Small is better" for OPIc delivery. "자 제가 좀 더 설명할게요": Instead of stiff phrases like "First, second, last, moreover, furthermore, to exemplify" (good for writing, bad for speaking), use smoother phrases like "Let me tell you more", "Let me explain", "Let me tell you in more detail". These are good strategies to use after the Main Point (MP) to signal further explanation and improve organization. Avoid overly formal or robotic language in speaking.
