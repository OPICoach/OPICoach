Feedback 
Good start! You introduced yourself clearly. You mentioned your name, profession/status, location, hobbies, and reason for taking the test. This covers the basics well. To make it even better, you could add a little more detail about one of your hobbies or a key characteristic about yourself. For example, instead of just 'I enjoy reading', you could say 'I really enjoy reading, especially mystery novels, because they keep me on the edge of my seat'. Your sentence structure is generally correct. 'I'm looking forward to improving my English speaking skills' is a good concluding sentence.
