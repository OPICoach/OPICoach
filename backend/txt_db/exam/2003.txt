Question 
What is your normal routine at home? What do you usually do during the weekdays? What kinds of things do you do on the weekend?

Answer 
Okay, my normal routine during the weekdays is quite busy. I usually wake up around 6:30 AM, get ready, and leave for work or school by 7:30. I spend most of the day working or studying. In the evening, I get home around 6 PM, have dinner, and then I might exercise, study more, or just relax by watching TV or reading. I usually go to bed around 11 PM. On the weekends, my routine is much more flexible. I usually sleep in a bit later, maybe until 8 or 9 AM. I often meet up with friends, go shopping, visit a park, or work on personal projects. Sometimes I just stay home and catch up on chores or relax. Weekends are for recharging after a busy week.

Feedback 
You clearly distinguished between your weekday and weekend routines. You provided specific times ('6:30 AM', '7:30', '6 PM', '11 PM', '8 or 9 AM'), which adds detail. You used good verbs to describe activities ('wake up', 'get ready', 'leave for', 'spend most of the day working/studying', 'get home', 'have dinner', 'exercise', 'study more', 'relax', 'go to bed', 'sleep in', 'meet up with', 'go shopping', 'visit', 'work on', 'stay home', 'catch up on chores', 'recharge'). The phrase 'sleep in a bit later' is very natural. 'Weekends are for recharging after a busy week' is a good concluding sentence. Well-structured and detailed.
