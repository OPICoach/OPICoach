Question 
Tell me about the house or apartment where you grew up. What did your home and the surrounding area look like when you were young? How has it changed?

Answer 
I grew up in an apartment building in a suburban area. Our apartment was on the fifth floor. It wasn't very big, but it was comfortable for our family. It had three bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen, and two bathrooms. I remember my room had posters of my favorite cartoon characters on the walls. The surrounding area used to be much quieter. There were more green spaces and fewer tall buildings. There was a small park nearby where I used to play with my friends. Over the years, the area has changed quite a lot. Many old buildings were torn down and replaced with modern, high-rise apartments and office buildings. The small park is still there, but it's been renovated and is much more crowded now. There are also many more shops and restaurants than before. It feels much more developed and busier now.

Feedback 
You gave a good description of your childhood home and its surroundings. You mentioned the type of building ('apartment building'), location ('suburban area', 'fifth floor'), size ('not very big, but comfortable'), and specific rooms and features ('three bedrooms', 'posters of my favorite cartoon characters'). Your description of the area 'when you were young' is clear, using comparative adjectives like 'quieter', 'more green spaces', 'fewer tall buildings'. You effectively described the changes using phrases like 'torn down and replaced with', 'renovated', 'much more crowded', 'many more shops and restaurants', 'much more developed and busier'. This shows good vocabulary and ability to compare past and present. Excellent use of detail and comparative language.
