Question 
What did you do at your last gathering or celebration? What was the occasion? Give me all the details about the gathering or celebration you had.

Answer 
My last gathering was just last weekend. It was a housewarming party for my friend, Sarah, who just moved into a new apartment. About fifteen of us gathered at her place on Saturday evening. The atmosphere was very relaxed and casual. Sarah ordered a lot of pizza and fried chicken, and people brought drinks and some side dishes. We spent the evening chatting, listening to music, and playing some board games. Sarah gave us a tour of her new apartment, which was nice. It was a really fun and low-key way to celebrate her new place and catch up with friends. We stayed until pretty late, maybe around midnight. It was a simple but very enjoyable gathering.

Feedback 
You clearly stated the occasion ('housewarming party') and when it happened ('last weekend'). You provided details about the number of people ('fifteen'), the location ('her place'), the food ('pizza and fried chicken', 'drinks and some side dishes'), and the activities ('chatting', 'listening to music', 'playing some board games', 'gave us a tour'). You used good descriptive words like 'relaxed and casual', 'fun and low-key', 'simple but very enjoyable'. Mentioning the time you stayed until ('around midnight') adds realism. This is a well-detailed and easy-to-follow description of the event.
