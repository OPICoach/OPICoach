Question 
Sometimes when people get together for celebrations or gatherings, unexpected things can happen. Tell me all about something unexpected that happened at a celebration or gathering in the area where you live. Describe what happened from beginning to end.

Answer 
Okay, I remember one unexpected thing that happened at a friend's birthday party a couple of years ago. It was a small party at his apartment. Everything was going well, we were eating cake and talking, when suddenly, the lights went out! The whole apartment building lost power. It was completely dark inside. At first, everyone was a bit surprised and confused. Someone joked that it was part of the birthday surprise. My friend quickly found some candles, so we lit those, and it actually created a really interesting atmosphere. We continued talking and laughing in the candlelight. The power didn't come back on for about an hour, but instead of ruining the party, it made it quite memorable and unique. We ended up telling ghost stories and singing songs by candlelight. It was totally unexpected, but it turned a normal birthday party into something quite special.

Feedback 
This is a great story about an unexpected event. You clearly set the scene ('friend's birthday party', 'his apartment', 'a couple of years ago'). You described the unexpected event precisely ('suddenly, the lights went out!', 'The whole apartment building lost power'). You explained the initial reaction ('surprised and confused', 'Someone joked'). You then described how the situation was handled ('friend quickly found some candles', 'lit those') and the resulting atmosphere ('created a really interesting atmosphere', 'continued talking and laughing in the candlelight'). You explained the duration ('power didn't come back on for about an hour') and the positive outcome ('made it quite memorable and unique', 'telling ghost stories and singing songs'). You used phrases like 'totally unexpected' and 'turned a normal birthday party into something quite special' to emphasize the impact. This is a well-structured narrative with good detail and vocabulary.
