Question 
Sometimes something unexpected happens while traveling. I wonder if you have ever experienced anything surprising, unexpected, or unusual while on a trip. Tell me the story of that experience in detail. Start by telling me when and where you were traveling, and then tell me all the details of that experience, especially what happened that made it so unforgettable.

Answer 
Okay, I had a surprising experience on a trip to Thailand a few years ago. I was traveling alone in Bangkok. I decided to visit a famous temple, and I took a local bus to get there. The bus was very crowded, and I was standing near the back. Suddenly, the bus stopped very abruptly, and I lost my balance and fell onto the floor! It was quite embarrassing, and my bag spilled open a little. Immediately, several people on the bus rushed to help me. They helped me stand up, picked up my things, and asked if I was okay. One elderly lady even offered me her seat. I was really touched by their kindness. In Korea, people might help, but maybe not so many people at once, and maybe not so proactively. It was unexpected because I was a foreigner, alone, and I didn't expect such an immediate and overwhelming response from strangers. It made me realize how kind and helpful Thai people can be, and it's something I'll never forget about that trip.

Feedback 
This is a compelling story about an unexpected event during travel. You clearly stated when and where ('Thailand', 'Bangkok', 'a few years ago') and who with ('traveling alone'). You set the scene ('took a local bus', 'very crowded', 'standing near the back'). You described the unexpected event ('bus stopped very abruptly', 'lost my balance and fell onto the floor!'). You included your reaction ('quite embarrassing', 'bag spilled open'). Crucially, you detailed the response of others ('Immediately, several people... rushed to help', 'helped me stand up', 'picked up my things', 'asked if I was okay', 'One elderly lady even offered me her seat'). You explained *why* it was unexpected and unforgettable by comparing it to your own culture ('In Korea, people might help, but maybe not so many people at once, and maybe not so proactively') and highlighting the impact ('realize how kind and helpful Thai people can be', 'something I'll never forget'). This is a well-structured narrative with good vocabulary and emotional detail.
