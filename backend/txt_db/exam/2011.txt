Question 
I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. You recently read a book about nutrition. Call the nutritionist's office and ask two or three questions.

Answer 
Okay, I will act it out. (Ring ring...) Hello, is this the nutritionist's office? Hi, my name is [Your Name]. I recently read a book about nutrition, and I had a couple of questions I was hoping someone could answer. First, the book mentioned something about macronutrient ratios for weight loss, but I'm a bit confused about how to calculate them for myself. Could you explain that? And second, I read that intermittent fasting can be beneficial, but I'm not sure if it's suitable for everyone, especially if they have certain health conditions. What are your thoughts on intermittent fasting, and who should avoid it? Thank you.

Feedback 
Excellent role-play! You started with a natural phone opening ('Hello, is this the nutritionist's office?'). You introduced yourself and the reason for calling ('Hi, my name is [Your Name]. I recently read a book...'). You clearly asked two distinct questions related to nutrition topics ('macronutrient ratios for weight loss', 'intermittent fasting'). You used phrases showing your uncertainty ('a bit confused', 'not sure if it's suitable for everyone'). You ended politely ('Thank you'). This demonstrates good conversational skills and the ability to ask for clarification and opinions.
