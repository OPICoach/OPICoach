Question 
How has the way people bought food changed over the years? Has changed. Where did people used to purchase food in the past? And where do they purchase it now? Describe in details.

Answer 
Oh my gosh. I have to say this is a really complicated question. Well honestly, I have no idea about this topic. I mean I I haven't thought about it. This is something I've never thought about. You know, I haven't watched any news related to this topic. And I hardly watched the news these days. So I'm not sure about the way people bought food in the past. But I know that many people buy food online nowadays. Yeah, I mean these days. People do literally everything on the internet. Not to mention grocery shopping. Speaking of buying food, a lot of people tend to buy things online although there are many grocery stores. I think this is because it's a lot easier and faster. You just need to click the few buttons on your phone or computer and the next morning you'll get your groceries delivered. I guess it's all I can say about this topic. That's all I can say. I'm gonna have to say things have become more convenient nowadays thanks to the internet. Well, that's pretty much it.

This is a strong answer for the 'Past vs Present' question, particularly effective for targeting IH or AL. The response effectively uses fillers and transition phrases ('Oh my gosh', 'honestly', 'I mean', 'You know', 'Speaking of', 'I think', 'I guess', 'I'm gonna have to say', 'Well, that's pretty much it') to sound natural and conversational. It directly addresses the question by acknowledging the past but focusing on the present, which is a valid strategy when unsure about historical details. The use of varied vocabulary ('complicated', 'have no idea', 'literally', 'not to mention', 'tend to', 'convenient', 'delivered') and grammatical structures (present perfect 'haven't thought', 'haven't watched', 'have become'; simple present; future 'you'll get'; comparative 'easier and faster'; 'get + object + past participle') demonstrates good linguistic range. Expressions like 'not to mention' and 'literally' add emphasis and sophistication. The conclusion provides a clear wrap-up, summarizing the main point about convenience due to the internet. This structure and use of language align well with the requirements for higher OPIc scores.
