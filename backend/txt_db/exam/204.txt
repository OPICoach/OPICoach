Question 
Tell me about the geography of your country. Are there a lot of lakes, rivers, beaches or mountains? Please describe it in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
That is an interesting question. I haven't thought of it much. Speaking of the geography of Korea, Korea is located on the Korean peninsula in the most eastern part of the Asian continent, facing the sea on three sides. The peninsula is also surrounded by thousands of volcanic islands. As for today, the country split into South and North Korea. The Korean War lasted for about three years from 1950 to 1953, and approximately 3 million Koreans, Americans, Chinese, and others died for that. The war was never officially ended and the Koreas remain divided. But in the minds of most of the Korean people, it remains a single nation that cannot be divided. South Korea has many mountains consisting of more than 70% of its territory. The tallest mountain in North Korea and the Korean peninsula altogether is Baekdusan, about 3,000 meters tall. The second tallest mountain in Korea is Hallasan, about 2,000 meters tall. Most summits are below 1,000 meters. We have notable islands ranging from Jeju to Dokdo. Jeju Island is the most southern and largest island of Korea and Dokdo is the most eastern island. South Korea is a small country with a huge population, so there is a huge demand for space. As a result, some large cities are increasingly centralized. More people have been moving into big cities like Seoul and Busan to get and keep jobs. These are what people call geographical features of South Korea and this is what the Korean geography is like.

This answer is structured into five parts to provide a comprehensive description of Korea's geography suitable for an AL score. The introduction 'That is an interesting question. I haven't thought of it much.' is a good strategy to buy time and manage expectations. Key vocabulary and phrases are introduced for each section: 1. Location and Peninsula: 'Korean peninsula', 'located on', 'most eastern part of the Asian continent', 'facing the sea on three sides', 'surrounded by thousands of volcanic islands'. 2. Division: 'split into', 'divided', 'Korean War', 'lasted for about three years', 'approximately', 'died for that', 'never officially ended', 'remain divided', 'in the minds of most of the Korean people', 'remains a single nation', 'cannot be divided'. Including the historical context of the Korean War adds depth. 3. Mountains: 'many mountains', 'consisting of more than 70% of its territory', 'tallest mountain' (using 'tall' for height from the ground), 'second tallest mountain', 'summits', 'below'. Specific mountains like Baekdusan and Hallasan with approximate heights are mentioned. 4. Islands: 'notable islands', 'ranging from A to B', 'most southern', 'largest island', 'most eastern island'. Jeju and Dokdo are used as examples. 5. Population and Urbanization: 'small country with a huge population', 'huge demand for space', 'increasingly centralized', 'moving into big cities', 'to get and keep jobs'. This section connects geography to social aspects like population density and urbanization. The conclusion summarizes the points. The level of detail, varied vocabulary (e.g., 'approximately', 'notable', 'centralized', 'increasingly'), and structured approach are highlighted as strengths for achieving a high score.
