9.  '집 외관은 화난 노란색으로 도색되어 있습니다.' - '화난 노란색' (angry yellow) is a very creative but unusual description for a house color. While creative language can be good, this might sound a bit strange or unnatural to a native speaker. (Translation: The exterior of the house is painted an angry yellow.) Consider using more standard color descriptions or explaining *why* it looks 'angry'.

13. '옷을 보관할 수 있는 널찍한 옷장이 있어요.' - Good sentence. (Translation: There is a spacious closet to store clothes.)
14. 'The kitchen is fully equipped with high-end appliances.' - Excellent sentence. 'Fully equipped' and 'high-end appliances' are good phrases.

19. '세탁실은 침실 근처에 위치하여 편리합니다.' - Good sentence. (Translation: The laundry room is conveniently located near the bedrooms.)
20. 'The dining room has a large table that can seat eight people.' - Good sentence. Providing specific details like the seating capacity is effective.
21. '집의 스웩에는 체중 감량을 위한 운동 기구가 설치되어 있습니다.' - This sentence contains a significant issue. '스웩' (swag) is a slang term and is completely inappropriate and nonsensical in this context when talking about a house feature. This phrase does not make sense in English or Korean when describing a place for exercise equipment. You likely mean something like 'home gym', 'exercise area', or perhaps a specific room. This sentence needs to be completely rephrased. (Literal, nonsensical translation: In the house's swag, exercise equipment for weight loss is installed.)
22. 'This is a spacious and modern house with plenty of natural light.' - Good summary sentence. Uses standard, effective adjectives.
23. '식료품 저장실은 정리가 잘 되어 있으며 깔끔하게 배열된 선반과 라벨이 달린 용기가 있습니다.' - Excellent sentence. Provides specific, detailed description which is great for AL. (Translation: The pantry is well-organized with neatly arranged shelves and labeled containers.)
24. 'The kitchen is equipped with modern appliances and granite countertops.' - Good sentence. Specific details like 'granite countertops' add realism.
25. '이 집은 에너지 효율적인 난방 및 냉방 시스템을 갖추고 있습니다.' - Good sentence. Relevant detail about the house's features. (Translation: The house has an energy-efficient heating and cooling system.)
26. 'The house is located in a quiet dead end.' - This is grammatically correct. 'Dead end' is understandable, but 'cul-de-sac' is the more formal term for a street with a dead end, or you could simply say 'a quiet street' or 'a quiet location'. 'Dead end' can sound a bit blunt.
27. '집 오피스는 생산성을 위한 책상과 책장이 갖추어져 있습니다.' - Good sentence. (Translation: The home office is equipped with a desk and bookshelves for productivity.)
28. 'The bathroom features a luxurious spa tub for relaxation.' - Excellent sentence. 'Luxurious spa tub' is good descriptive vocabulary.
29. '발코니는 모닝 커피를 즐기기에 좋은 장소입니다.' - Good sentence. (Translation: The balcony is a great place to enjoy morning coffee.)
30. 'A wooden bookshelf is packed with a variety of books from classic novels to contemporary bestsellers.' - Excellent sentence. Provides specific detail about the contents, showing fluency.
31. '변기에는 비데가 장착되어 개인 위생과 쾌적성을 높였다.' - Good sentence. Specific detail. (Translation: The toilet is equipped with a bidet, enhancing personal hygiene and comfort.)
