Question 
Let's start the interview now. Tell me about yourself.

Answer 
Okay, I'm currently a university student majoring in computer science. I'm in my third year. I chose this major because I've always been fascinated by technology and how it can solve problems. In my free time, I enjoy coding personal projects and playing video games. I also like hiking on weekends.

Feedback 
Good start. You introduced yourself clearly, mentioning your major, year, and interests. To improve, you could elaborate slightly more on why you chose computer science or what kind of personal projects you work on. Ensure smooth flow between sentences.
