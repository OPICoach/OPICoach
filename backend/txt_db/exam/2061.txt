Question 
When and where do you listen to music? Do you listen to the radio? Or do you go to concerts?

Answer 
I usually listen to music when I'm commuting to school on the bus or subway. It helps the time pass quickly. I also listen at home while I'm studying or just relaxing. I don't really listen to the radio anymore, but I do try to go to concerts if my favorite artists are performing nearby. I went to a BTS concert a few years ago, and it was amazing.

You gave specific situations for listening to music and addressed the questions about radio and concerts. Mentioning the BTS concert adds a nice personal touch. For more detail, you could describe the atmosphere of the concert or how music affects your mood while studying.
