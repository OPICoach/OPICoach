Question 
When did you first become interested in listening to music? What kind of music did you listen to when you were a child? How has your interest in music changed over time?

Answer 
I think I started really getting into music in elementary school. Back then, I listened to whatever was popular on TV, mostly pop songs and maybe some children's songs. As I got older, in middle and high school, I started exploring different genres like rock and R&B. Now, as I mentioned, I mostly listen to K-pop and indie, but I also appreciate classical music sometimes. My taste has definitely broadened over the years.

Feedback 
Good explanation of the evolution of your music taste over time. You used phrases like 'back then' and 'as I got older' effectively. To make it even better, you could give a specific example of a song or artist from your childhood or explain *why* your taste broadened.
