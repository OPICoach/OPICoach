Question 
Tell me about your country's geography. Are there mountains, rivers, or lakes in your country?

Answer 
My country, South Korea, has a very diverse geography, but it's mostly mountainous. About 70% of the land is covered by mountains. We have many beautiful mountain ranges. There are also many rivers, the most famous one being the Han River which flows through Seoul. We have some lakes, but they are often artificial reservoirs rather than natural ones. The coastline is also quite long, with many islands.

Feedback 
You provided a comprehensive overview of Korea's geography, mentioning mountains, rivers, lakes, and the coastline. Citing the percentage of mountainous land and naming the Han River are good details. To add more depth, you could mention different regions or climates.
