Question 
What are some typical activities people in your country do? Do they go hiking, swimming, or ride their bicycles?

Answer 
Yes, all of those activities are popular. Because of the mountains, hiking is a very common pastime for people of all ages. Cycling is also popular, especially along the rivers or on dedicated bike paths. Swimming is popular in the summer, either at beaches or swimming pools. Besides outdoor activities, people also spend a lot of time socializing at cafes or restaurants.

Feedback 
You listed relevant activities and connected them to the geography (hiking in mountains, cycling along rivers). Mentioning cafes/restaurants adds another dimension to typical activities. To elaborate, you could describe *why* hiking is so popular or mention seasonal activities.
