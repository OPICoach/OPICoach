Question 
Tell me about a special landscape you've seen. What is special about it? When did you see it?

Answer 
A special landscape I've seen is Udo Island, which is near Jeju Island. I visited it last summer. What's special about it is its unique shape, which looks like a cow lying down, and its beautiful coastal scenery with clear turquoise water. It feels very peaceful and less crowded than Jeju main island. I remember seeing the black lava cliffs and the white sand beach made of crushed coral.

Feedback 
You described a specific place and time, explaining what makes it special with sensory details (cow shape, turquoise water, black cliffs, white sand). This is a strong response. You could add how you felt experiencing this landscape.
