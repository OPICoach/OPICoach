Question 
Tell me about the first time you went to a coffee shop. When was it? Who did you go with? What do you remember the most about it?

Answer 
I think my first time going to a proper coffee shop was when I was in high school, maybe around 16 years old. I went with a group of friends after finishing our exams. I remember feeling very grown-up because before that, we usually just went to fast-food places. I didn't drink coffee, so I ordered a sweet green tea latte. I remember the comfortable chairs and the smell of coffee, and how we talked for hours about the exams and our plans for the summer.

Feedback 
You provided a clear memory with details about the time, companions, and what you remember most (feeling grown-up, the drink, the atmosphere, the conversation). This is a great personal story. You could add a little more about the specific cafe or the feeling of independence.
