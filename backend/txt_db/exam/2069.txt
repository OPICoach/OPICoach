Question 
I'm sorry, but there's a problem I want you to resolve. You made an appointment with your doctor, but something came up, so you cannot make it. Call the doctor's office, explain the situation, and reschedule the appointment.

Answer 
(Acting out) Hello, I'm calling because I need to cancel and reschedule my appointment. My name is [Your Name], and I had an appointment with Dr. Lee on [Date] at [Time]. Unfortunately, something unexpected came up, and I won't be able to make it. I apologize for any inconvenience. Could I please reschedule for sometime next week? What dates and times are available?

Feedback 
Excellent role-play. You clearly explained the situation, identified yourself and the appointment, apologized, and asked to reschedule while inquiring about availability. This shows strong problem-solving and communication skills in English. The language used is appropriate and polite.
