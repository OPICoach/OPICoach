Question 
You indicated in a survey that you take vacations domestically. How is traveling different now compared to the past? Do you think traveling is easier or more difficult now than before?

Answer 
I think domestic travel is definitely easier now than in the past, mainly because of technology. In the past, you had to go to a travel agency or call places to book things. Now, you can book everything online instantly â€“ transportation like trains or buses, accommodation, and even local activities. Finding information about destinations is also much easier with the internet and apps. This convenience makes planning and taking trips much simpler.

Feedback 
You clearly stated your opinion (easier) and provided specific, relevant reasons related to technology and online booking/information access. This is a strong point. You could add a brief personal example of how technology helped you on a recent trip.
