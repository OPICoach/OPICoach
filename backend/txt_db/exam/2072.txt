Question 
Tell me about some issues concerning traveling. How do people handle those issues or problems?

Answer 
One common issue is dealing with crowds, especially during peak holiday seasons. Popular tourist spots can become very crowded, which can be stressful. People try to handle this by traveling during off-peak times if possible, or by researching less-known but equally beautiful places. Another issue can be unexpected problems like transportation delays or cancellations. In those cases, people usually contact the service provider, like the train company or airline, to find alternative arrangements or seek compensation. Having travel insurance can also help with unexpected issues.

Feedback 
You identified relevant travel issues (crowds, unexpected delays) and suggested practical solutions people use (traveling off-peak, researching alternatives, contacting providers, using insurance). This shows good vocabulary related to problems and solutions. To make it more personal, you could share a time you encountered one of these issues and how you dealt with it.
