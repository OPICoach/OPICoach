Question 
Tell me about yourself. You indicated in the survey that you enjoy listening to music. What kind of music do you like? Who is your favorite musician or composer? When and where do you typically listen to music? Is there any particular place you find special for enjoying music? Can you tell me when and why you listen to music, providing me with all the details? When did you first become interested in music? Was there any person who influenced your music preference? Do you still listen to the same kind of music that you did when you were young? Has your music preference changed? Tell me about a particular time when you went to listen to some live music. Did you go to concerts or a live cafe? What did you do there, and what happened? What made this experience memorable?

Answer 
Okay, I'm [Your Name], I work as a [Your Job/Student]. I really enjoy music. I like many kinds, but mostly pop and R&B. My favorite singer is [Favorite Singer's Name]. I listen to music everyday, usually when I commute or when I'm relaxing at home. My room is special for music. I listen to feel happy or sometimes when I'm sad. I started liking music in middle school, maybe because of my friends. My taste changed a little, I listen to more diverse music now. Last year, I went to a concert for [Artist's Name]. It was very exciting to see them live. The energy was amazing.

Feedback 
Your answer covers many points from the questions. Good job mentioning your job/student status and your music preferences. To improve, try to provide more detail and examples. For instance, instead of just saying 'many kinds', maybe name a few more genres. When talking about *why* you listen, elaborate on how music makes you feel in different situations. For the live music experience, describe the atmosphere, what the artist did, and why it was 'exciting' or the energy was 'amazing'. Using connecting words and phrases (like 'for example', 'in addition', 'as a result') would make your answer flow more smoothly.
