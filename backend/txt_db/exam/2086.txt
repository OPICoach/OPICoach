Question 
Tell me about the public transportation system in your country. What kind of transportation do people use to get around? Tell me everything about how people get to work or school every day. How has transportation changed over the years? How is the way people get around different now compared to the past? Problems can occur when using transportation. Trains run late, traffic gets jammed. Tell me about a time when you had trouble due to a certain mode of transportation.

Answer 
In my country, Korea, public transport is very good. Many people use subways and buses for work or school. It's convenient and usually on time. Compared to the past, the system is more modern, with apps for schedules and payments. Also, there are more lines now. But sometimes, there are problems. Once, the subway broke down during rush hour. It was very crowded, and I was late for an important meeting. It was frustrating because there was no other way to get there fast.

Feedback 
You gave a good overview of public transportation in Korea, mentioning subways, buses, and the use of apps. You also provided a relevant example of a problem. To enhance your answer, you could elaborate on *how* the system is more modern (e.g., real-time information, cleaner stations) or describe the 'very good' aspect with more specifics. When describing the subway breakdown, use more descriptive language about the 'crowded' situation and your feelings ('frustrating'). Using phrases like 'as a result' or 'consequently' could link the breakdown to being late.
