Question 
I'd like to know about your eating experience. Can you tell me about foreign food you've tried? What was it? Where did you try it? Tell me about interesting food you had in the past.

Answer 
I like trying foreign food. I tried Mexican food, like tacos and burritos, in a restaurant in Seoul. It was spicy but very delicious. An interesting food I had was maybe 'sannakji', live octopus. It was very fresh and chewy, a unique experience.

Feedback 
You provided examples of foreign and interesting food you've tried. Good job mentioning where you tried the Mexican food and describing the taste ('spicy but delicious'). For the 'sannakji', describing the texture ('chewy') and calling it a 'unique experience' is good. To expand, you could compare the foreign food to Korean food, or describe the 'interesting' food experience in more detail â€“ how did you feel trying it? Was it challenging? Adding more descriptive adjectives would be helpful.
