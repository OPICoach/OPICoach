Question 
Do you have any similar experience where something was broken or damaged in your house? What happened that day? How did you fix the problem? Tell me about your experience in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
Yes, I had a problem with my refrigerator once. It suddenly stopped working, and all the food inside started to spoil. It happened on a weekend. I called a repair shop, but they couldn't come until Monday. So, I had to throw away a lot of food, which was a waste. When the repairman came, he fixed a part, and it worked again. It was inconvenient.

Feedback 
You described a relevant experience with a broken appliance. You explained what happened (stopped working, food spoiled), when (weekend), the consequence (had to throw away food), how it was fixed (repairman fixed a part), and your feeling (inconvenient). To add more detail, you could specify *which* part was fixed (if you know), describe the state of the spoiled food, or explain *why* it was inconvenient (e.g., 'I couldn't cook at home', 'I had to eat out'). Using transition words like 'fortunately' (when it was fixed) or 'unfortunately' (about the spoiled food) would improve flow.
