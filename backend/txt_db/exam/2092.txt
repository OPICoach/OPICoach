Question 
How have coffee shops changed over the years? How were they like in the past, and what about now? Tell me all the changes in detail. When friends and family members evaluate coffee shops in terms of what they like and dislike, what are some of the issues they discuss most frequently? How do some of these issues influence their experience at a coffee shop?

Answer 
Coffee shops changed a lot. In the past, they were simple places just for coffee. Now, they are like cultural spaces. They offer many drinks, not just coffee, and also food. The design is also important now, they are very stylish. People go there to study, work, or meet friends, not just drink coffee. When my friends talk about coffee shops, they care about the atmosphere, the taste of the coffee, and the price. If the atmosphere is bad or the coffee is not good, they won't go there again. Price is also important for students.

Feedback 
You provided a good comparison of past and present coffee shops, highlighting changes in purpose, offerings, and design. You also identified key factors people consider (atmosphere, taste, price) and how they influence decisions. To elaborate, you could give examples of 'many drinks' or 'food' offered now. Describe the 'stylish' design more specifically (e.g., modern, cozy, unique). For the evaluation criteria, explain *why* atmosphere or taste is important (e.g., 'atmosphere affects relaxation', 'taste is the main reason for coffee lovers'). Using comparative structures ('whereas in the past', 'compared to before') would make the contrast clearer.
