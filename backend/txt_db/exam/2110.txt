Question 
Please introduce the public transportation that people often use in your country. What are some of its features? And how often do you use it?

Answer 
In my country, the most common public transportation are the subway and buses. The subway system is very extensive, especially in big cities, and it's known for being very efficient and punctual. Buses cover almost every area, including smaller towns. A key feature is the integrated fare system, where you can use a single card for both the subway and buses, and transfers are often free or discounted. I use public transportation almost every day. I take the bus to university, and I use the subway maybe two or three times a week to meet friends or go shopping.

Feedback 
You clearly identified the main types of public transportation and mentioned a key feature (integrated fare system). Using words like 'extensive,' 'efficient,' and 'punctual' is good vocabulary. You also clearly stated how often you use them. To enhance your answer, you could briefly mention another feature, like cleanliness or availability of information (apps, signs). Your sentence structure is good.
