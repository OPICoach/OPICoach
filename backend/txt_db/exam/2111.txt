Question 
What are the most striking changes when comparing past and present transportation? Please describe the characteristics of past and present public transportation in detail and compare them as much as possible.

Answer 
The most striking change is definitely the level of modernization and integration. In the past, public transportation, especially buses, might have been less frequent and less reliable. Subway lines were fewer. Payment often required cash. Nowadays, everything is much more advanced. We have smart cards or even mobile payments, real-time tracking apps for buses and subways, and the network of routes has expanded dramatically. Transfers between different modes are seamless. So, compared to the past, present public transportation is much faster, more convenient, and technologically driven.

Feedback 
You effectively highlighted modernization and integration as the main changes. You provided specific examples like payment methods (cash vs. smart cards/mobile), tracking apps, and network expansion. Using comparative language like 'less frequent,' 'less reliable,' 'much more advanced,' and 'seamless' is excellent. Your comparison is detailed and clear. Good job using transition words like 'especially' and 'nowadays.'
