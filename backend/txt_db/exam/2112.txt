Question 
Have you encountered any issues while using public transportation? What was the issue and what measures did you take to resolve the situation? Please tell me what you learned from that experience.

Answer 
Yes, I have. One time, I was on the subway during rush hour, and it suddenly stopped between stations due to a technical issue. We were stuck there for about 30 minutes. It was very crowded and hot. My issue was that I was on my way to an important appointment. To resolve it, I immediately checked my phone for alternative routes and called the person I was meeting to inform them I would be late and explain the situation. From this experience, I learned the importance of checking for potential delays before leaving, especially during peak hours, and always having a backup plan or contact information ready.

Feedback 
You described a common and relatable issue (subway breakdown during rush hour) and its consequence (being late for an appointment). Your actions to resolve it (checking alternatives, calling ahead) are practical and well-explained. The lesson you learned is clear and valuable. Your narrative flows well. Using descriptive words like 'crowded' and 'hot' adds detail to the situation.
