Question 
You indicated in the survey that you enjoy traveling abroad. What is the most memorable experience you've had while traveling abroad? What made that experience so special?

Answer 
My most memorable experience was visiting the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu in Peru. I went there a few years ago. What made it so special was the incredible scenery and the sense of history. Standing there, looking at the mountains and the ancient city, felt truly breathtaking. It was a challenging hike to get there, but the view and the atmosphere were absolutely worth it. It felt like stepping back in time and connecting with a different civilization. It was a unique combination of natural beauty and historical significance.

Feedback 
Excellent choice of a memorable location and clear explanation of why it was special. You used strong adjectives like 'incredible,' 'breathtaking,' 'challenging,' and 'unique.' Connecting the experience to both natural beauty and historical significance is a good point. Your description of the feeling ('stepping back in time,' 'connecting with a different civilization') is evocative. Good job.
