Question 
Where did you travel abroad for the first time in your life? With whom and when did you travel, and what were the main reasons for choosing that travel destination? Please describe the process of planning the trip in detail. From the planning stage to the moment of the trip.

Answer 
My first trip abroad was to Japan, specifically Tokyo, about ten years ago. I went with my family. We chose Japan because my parents were interested in its culture, and my siblings and I were big fans of Japanese animation and food. The planning process started several months before the trip. We researched different areas in Tokyo online and in guidebooks. My dad handled booking the flights and hotel. My mom planned the itinerary, looking up famous landmarks, museums, and restaurants. We also bought Japan Rail Passes for easy transportation. We packed our bags, exchanged currency, and finally, the day arrived. Going through the airport, taking the flight, and arriving in a completely different country felt very exciting and a bit overwhelming at first.

Feedback 
You provided all the requested details: destination, companions, time, and reasons. Your description of the planning process is thorough, mentioning research, booking, itinerary planning, transportation passes, packing, and currency exchange. You also included your feelings upon arrival ('exciting,' 'a bit overwhelming'). This detailed narrative is very good for OPIc. Using phrases like 'specifically Tokyo' and 'big fans of' adds natural detail.
