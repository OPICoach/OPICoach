Question 
Tell me about the most memorable travel experience you had. When and where did you go? What did you see? Who did you go with? What happened? Why was this experience unforgettable to you?

Answer 
Okay, I think the trip to Machu Picchu I mentioned earlier is truly the most unforgettable. It was a few years ago, and I went with a friend. We traveled to Peru and took a train and then hiked part of the Inca Trail to reach Machu Picchu. We saw the ancient city ruins, the surrounding mountains, and the Urubamba River far below. What happened was that the hike was more challenging than we expected, especially the altitude, but pushing through and finally seeing the site appear through the mist was an incredible moment. It was unforgettable because it combined physical effort with immense historical and natural beauty. It was a profound experience that made me appreciate human history and the power of nature.

Feedback 
It's perfectly fine to refer back to a previous answer and elaborate. You added more specific details about *how* you got there (train, hike), who you were with (a friend), and the specific challenge (altitude) and reward (seeing the site through the mist). Your explanation of *why* it was unforgettable is more detailed here, connecting physical effort with beauty and leading to a 'profound experience.' This shows good ability to expand on a topic.
