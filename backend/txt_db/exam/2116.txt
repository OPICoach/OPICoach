Question 
Please describe the places where people in your country spend their leisure time. Why do people want to spend their free time in those places? And what activities do they mainly do in those places?

Answer 
People in my country spend their leisure time in various places. Cafes are extremely popular; people go there to relax, chat with friends, study, or work remotely. Parks are also common, especially on weekends, for walking, jogging, having picnics, or just enjoying nature. Shopping malls are another major destination, offering not just shopping but also restaurants, cinemas, and entertainment centers. Additionally, many people enjoy hiking in the mountains or visiting coastal areas for relaxation and outdoor activities. People seek these places for relaxation, socialization, entertainment, or physical activity, depending on their interests.

Feedback 
You listed several popular leisure spots and clearly explained the reasons people go there and the activities they do. Mentioning cafes for studying/working remotely and shopping malls for entertainment centers adds good detail about modern usage. Including both urban spots (cafes, malls) and natural areas (parks, mountains, coast) provides a comprehensive picture. Your summary sentence about *why* people seek these places is effective.
