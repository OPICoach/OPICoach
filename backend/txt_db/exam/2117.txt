Question 
Do you have more or less free time compared to the past? Please describe your changed free time compared to the past and explain why your free time has changed.

Answer 
Compared to the past, I definitely have less free time now. When I was in middle school or high school, although I had school, I usually finished classes earlier and had more unstructured time in the evenings or on weekends. Now, as a university student, my schedule is packed with lectures, seminars, group projects, and studying. I also have a part-time job to help with expenses. So, the amount of free time I have has significantly decreased, and the free time I do have is often used for catching up on rest or essential errands rather than purely leisure activities. The change is mainly due to increased academic workload and financial responsibilities.

Feedback 
You clearly stated that you have less free time and explained *why* by comparing your current situation (university, part-time job, workload) to the past (earlier finish times, unstructured time). Using words like 'unstructured,' 'packed,' 'significantly decreased,' and 'essential errands' adds good vocabulary. Your explanation for the change (academic workload, financial responsibilities) is logical and well-articulated.
