Question 
Please tell me about the most recent free time you had. What did you do? And how did you feel after spending your free time? Please describe it in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
My most recent free time was yesterday evening. After finishing my classes and dinner, I had about two hours free. I decided to spend it relaxing at home. I put on some comfortable clothes, made myself a cup of tea, and watched an episode of a TV series I've been following. After that, I spent about 30 minutes just browsing social media and chatting with a friend online. I felt very relaxed and recharged after this free time. It was simple, but it was a good way to unwind after a busy day and prepare myself for the next day's schedule. I felt a sense of calm and satisfaction.

Feedback 
You provided specific details about when (yesterday evening), how long (two hours), and what you did (tea, TV series, social media, chatting). Your description of how you felt ('relaxed,' 'recharged,' 'unwind,' 'calm,' 'satisfaction') is excellent and detailed. This shows good ability to describe feelings and reflect on an experience. The narrative flows well.
