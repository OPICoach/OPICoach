Question 
I'm sorry, but you have a problem to solve. When you moved to a new house, you found that there is a leak in the wall. Describe the problem situation in detail when you call the repair shop. Also, provide two to three reasons why the repair needs to be done today.

Answer 
Hello, I just moved into a new house at [Address]. I'm calling because I have a serious problem. There's a water leak on the wall in the living room, near the ceiling. I noticed it this morning, and it looks like a wet patch that is slowly spreading downwards. It feels damp to the touch, and I can see a slight discoloration. I need this repaired today urgently for a few reasons. Firstly, I'm worried the water will cause significant damage to the wall structure and the floor if it's not stopped immediately. Secondly, I have expensive furniture placed near that wall, and I'm afraid it will get ruined by the water. Thirdly, a leak could indicate a burst pipe or a serious plumbing issue that needs immediate professional attention to prevent further, more extensive damage.

Feedback 
You described the problem situation very well, providing details about the location, appearance (wet patch, spreading, discoloration), and feel (damp). Your reasons for needing the repair done today are logical and compelling (preventing damage to structure/floor, protecting furniture, potential serious plumbing issue). This is a strong response for a problem-solving task. Using words like 'serious problem,' 'slowly spreading,' 'significant damage,' and 'extensive damage' emphasizes the urgency.
