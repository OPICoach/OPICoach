Question 
Have you ever had an experience where something broke or malfunctioned and caused inconvenience? What was that? And how did you feel about that at first? Please describe it in detail.

Answer 
Yes, I have. About six months ago, my smartphone suddenly died and wouldn't turn back on. This caused a huge inconvenience because I use my phone for everything â€“ communication, banking, navigation, work emails, and even my transport card is linked to it. At first, I felt completely lost and panicked. It was like losing my connection to the world. I felt frustrated because I couldn't contact anyone easily or access important information. I had to borrow a friend's old phone temporarily and spend time dealing with repairs and data recovery, which was a stressful process. It made me realize how dependent I am on my phone.

Feedback 
You chose a common but very impactful item (smartphone) and clearly explained the extensive inconvenience it caused by listing its various uses. Your description of your initial feelings ('completely lost,' 'panicked,' 'frustrated') is vivid and relatable. You also mentioned the subsequent actions (borrowing a phone, dealing with repairs/data recovery) and the final realization about dependency. This is a detailed and well-structured response.
