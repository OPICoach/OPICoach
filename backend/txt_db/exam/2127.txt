Feedback 
The question asks about your routine on weekdays and weekends at home. This is a habit category question. The student correctly identifies as a student and mentions spending time at the library on weekdays, implying less time at home. This is a good start to address the weekday part (even if briefly). The student then focuses on weekends, which aligns with the strategy of controlling the question by focusing on one part (weekends) more than the other (weekdays). However, the grammar "I didn't have much time on weekdays" should be "I don't have much time on weekdays" as it's a general habit/current situation, not a past event. Suggestion: Add a brief reason for not being home much on weekdays (e.g., "because I'm always studying/working"). The phrase "on weekend" should be "on weekends" (plural). The student expresses emotion about loving weekend time, which is good. The grammar "I can do everything what I want" is awkward; better options are "I can do whatever I want" or "I can do whatever I feel like." The overuse of "Yeah" is noticeable and should be reduced or replaced with other fillers or pauses. The phrase "I love watch movies" should be "I love watching movies." The transition "but you know what?" could be smoother, maybe just "And you know what?" or "Also, you know what?" The word "flexed" is incorrect in this context; the student likely meant "relaxed." Better phrases are "It helps me relax" or "It makes me feel relaxed." The student then introduces other activities (listening to music, catching some Z's) which breaks the focus on movies (Rule ) and introduces potentially uncomfortable vocabulary ("catch some Z's"). This seems driven by nervousness or feeling the answer is too short. Instead of adding unrelated points, the student should either elaborate on the movie topic using habit strategies (like quick comparison - e.g., "I never used to watch movies this much, but nowadays I love it") or go directly to a conclusion if they have nothing more to say about movies (Rule ). The phrase "the another thing is" is grammatically incorrect; it should be "another thing is" or "and another thing I like to do is..." The conclusion "These things are makes me full of energy" has grammatical errors ("are makes" should be "make"). Overall, the student shows potential by attempting to control the question and use some good vocabulary ("usually"), but struggles with grammar, awkward phrasing, overuse of fillers, and breaking focus when nervous.
