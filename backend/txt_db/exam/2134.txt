Question 
Recycling is a common practice. Tell me about all the different kinds of things that you recycle.

Answer 
Okay, so recycling... It's just plastic. You know like I have like piles and piles of plastic like every like every day. It's ridiculous. I have so much plastic though I just live alone, you know. Um like to tell you more like for some reason these days. you know, I usually take out food and um they only use plastic containers, those humongous ones. And also they give those plastic containers in the plastic bags, right? And plastic spoons, plastic containers and plastic whatever. And I'm like what the heck? I have those like in my place. Like I have those like cans and bottles and like paper, but I only take out plastic like every other day. So, you know, like without plastic is my recycling, right? And I'm so annoyed. I am so annoyed because I have to wash like wash all those containers, right? Like doing the dishes. So what's the point of taking, you know, taking out all the food, right? So, yeah, this is pretty much I can say.

Feedback 
The answer starts smoothly with "Okay, so recycling..." showing thought process. The general main point "It's just plastic. You know like I have like piles and piles of plastic like every like every day." is clear and effective for a Habit question. The use of "It's ridiculous" adds strong emotion and good vocabulary. Connecting the recycling habit to personal experience like ordering take out food makes the answer relatable and less generic. The pronoun "they" is used effectively to refer to the restaurants/delivery services. Vocabulary like "humongous" is an excellent, advanced alternative to "huge". The phrase "plastic whatever" is a very natural and informal way to say "etc." or "and so on". The inclusion of a direct quotation "And I'm like what the heck?" is an advanced technique that adds personality and shows high fluency, especially in a Habit response. The repetition "I'm so annoyed. I am so annoyed." is effective for emphasizing emotion, particularly with the slight variation in contraction. While "wash" is understandable, "rinse out" might be a slightly more precise term for cleaning recycling containers. The ending "So, yeah, this is pretty much I can say." is slightly awkward; "all I have to say" or "all I got to say" would sound more natural. Overall, the answer is very natural, personal, uses advanced vocabulary and techniques, and demonstrates strong control of the language despite not having specifically practiced OPIc recently.
