Question 
what is your go-to comfort food?

Answer 
My comfort food is Kim (김). I like it because I get salt cravings all the time. I used to eat it often, but not just by itself. I eat it when I get hungry around dinner time so that I don't gain weight. I also like Kimbap, but we don't have a Kimbap place nearby. If I couldn't eat Kim, it would be okay because I could just eat meat instead.

Feedback

There's always the more expensive alternative.
