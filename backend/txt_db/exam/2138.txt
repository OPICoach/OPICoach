Question 
The handling of recycling materials has changed over the years. Tell me how the collection of recycling materials used to be in the past and how it has evolved to the present.

Answer 
Wow, that's very interesting question. I think it goes with some kind of uh the development or the history of my country. Uh like um right like nowadays, like I said, like lots of containers. I know you're sick of it because I'm like plastic, plastic, plastic, right? But the thing is that um like we use a lot of plastic containers and those are like, to be honest with you, they're quite fancy and um very well, I don't know how to put it. I put it Well, yeah, they're really come out with lots of packages, I should say. Like, like, when it comes to the environment, I think it's kind of unnecessary, you know, harmful to the environment. And I think uh it's all it has to do all with the development or like the situation of Korea. I mean, we're getting richer and richer and using more plastic and a lot of throwaway stuff. But like in the past, this wasn't the case. I'm not sure you might know this, but Korea was one of the poorest countries, right? And so, I think back in the days, uh my parents and mom uh my parents generation, they used to save up a lot of materials. And they, you know, they couldn't stand wasting any materials, right? So, they would use the stuff again and again. My parents would use the containers all over again, you know, just I like I said, I throw away things, but they would just clean it up, use cover uh several more times. So, they were very, I don't know, like frugal. And I kind of like that way. But like right now, we're kind of more geared into like American way, which is not really good. I I hope not you're American. Anyways, you guys they they're like spending, spending, spending, right? So, they end up, you know, end up like swimming in the seas of plastic container, just like I said in the previous question. So, hopefully, uh in some way, uh we'll be able to get back to that kind of the, you know, circumstance that we can save up more materials. Uh what I say is that we waste a lot of materials.

Feedback 
Overall, the answer demonstrates very good English proficiency, likely AL level. However, some parts could be clearer with better organization and strategy.

Specific feedback points:
- "I know you're sick of it because I'm like plastic, plastic, plastic, right?": Excellent connection to previous answers, shows awareness and lack of script, good communication skill.
- "But the thing is that": Good, skillful expression for transition.
- "to be honest with you, they're quite fancy": Describes modern plastic containers.
- "I don't know how to put it.": Natural hesitation, good expression. Alternatives: "I don't know how to say it," "I don't know how to put it in words," "I don't know how to describe it."
- "When it comes to the environment, I think it's kind of unnecessary, you know, harmful to the environment.": Good point about excessive/fancy packaging being unnecessary and harmful.
- "it has to do all with the development or like the situation of Korea. I mean, we're getting richer and richer and using more plastic and a lot of throwaway stuff.": Good explanation linking Korea's economic development to increased use of plastic and disposable items ("throwaway stuff" is fine, similar to "disposable").
- "But like in the past, this wasn't the case.": Good expression meaning "it wasn't like this" or "it was completely different."
- "I'm not sure you might know this, but Korea was one of the poorest countries, right?": Good way to address the grader naturally without using awkward phrases like "Do you know?" or mentioning the grader's name (Ava).
- "my parents and mom uh my parents generation": Minor, natural self-correction.
- "they couldn't stand wasting any materials, right?": "Couldn't stand" means "couldn't bear" or "hated," a strong and good expression. Similar to "couldn't put up with."
- "My parents would use the containers all over again": "Again and again" is slightly more natural than "all over again" in this context (all over again usually means starting from the beginning).
- "So, they were very, I don't know, like frugal.": Using "I don't know" mid-sentence adds naturalness and avoids a scripted feel. "Frugal" is a good word meaning smart/careful with money (positive connotation, unlike "cheap").
- "But like right now, we're kind of more geared into like American way, which is not really good. I I hope not you're American. Anyway.": This comment about the "American way" being "not really good" followed by "I hope you're not American" is risky. The grader is likely American, and while likely intended lightly, it could be perceived negatively or awkwardly. It's safer to avoid potentially critical comments about the grader's country or culture.
- "they're like spending, spending, spending, right? So, they end up, you know, end up like swimming in the seas of plastic container, just like I said in the previous question.": Describes the consequence of excessive spending/disposables, using a vivid image ("swimming in the seas of plastic").
- Overall structure: While fluent, the main point about the *evolution* of *collection* methods (which was the core of the question) wasn't explicitly addressed. The answer focused more on the *materials* used and the *mindset* towards waste in the past vs. present, linking it to economic status. This made the answer slightly confusing regarding the specific question about the *handling/collection* process change.
- Recommendation: For AL, focus on clear structure and directly addressing all parts of the question while maintaining natural fluency and advanced vocabulary/expressions.
