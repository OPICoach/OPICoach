Feedback 
Starting with 'Hi, I'm Rachel' is excellent and smoother than 'Hi, my name is Rachel'. The use of fillers like 'uh' and 'actually' shows thinking, which is okay, but avoid excessive repetition of the same filler ('actually'). Saying 'I don't know what to tell you about myself' is an honest and good response; 'I don't really know...' would be slightly more natural. Correct 'I really into K-pop music' to 'I'm really into K-pop music'. 'I'm really into K-pop music' is a smooth expression showing strong interest. 'You know what?' is a natural and bright phrase to use. 'I gained a lot of weight these days, so I need to lose my weight' is a natural expression that demonstrates the ability to connect cause and effect simply, which is key for AL. Practice expressing this simple connection quickly. Adding 'really' before 'need to lose' can add emphasis. 'These days' is correct; avoid 'in these days'. Correcting a mistake once or twice is fine, but don't dwell on it if you keep making errors; just move on. The tense should be 'I decided to go...' instead of 'I decide to go...'. A more natural way to express going to a dance academy for lessons is 'I decided to take K-pop dance lessons to lose my weight', as English often focuses on the person/action (taking lessons) rather than just the place (academy). Avoid repeating 'actually' multiple times as it can sound nervous. Correct 'I took twice just twice class' to 'I only took two classes so far this week'. 'So far' is a useful keyword meaning 'until now'. The use of 'and' before 'I'm gonna keep learning' is good. 'Going to' vs 'gonna' is a matter of personal preference. 'And that's pretty much what I have to say about myself' is a good closing. Changing 'what' to 'all' ('And that's pretty much all I have to say about myself') makes it even smoother and is highly recommended. Overall, the answer demonstrates the AL characteristic of being able to talk continuously and elaborate on simple points, which is more important than speaking speed.
