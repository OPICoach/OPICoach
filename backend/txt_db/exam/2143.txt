Answer 
I go to a park near my home. It is called Central Park. It is quite big and have many trees and a lake. There are also benches and walking paths. I usually go there to walk or run. Sometimes I meet my friend there and we talk. I like this park because it is quiet and beautiful. It is a good place to relax.

Feedback 
Okay, this is a good start! You answered all parts of the question. Let's look at how we can make it even better and sound more natural.

*   **"I go to a park near my home."**: Good opening sentence. Clear and direct.
*   **"It is called Central Park."**: Also good. States the name.
*   **"It is quite big and have many trees and a lake."**: Here, "have" should be "has" because the subject "It" is singular. So, "It is quite big and **has** many trees and a lake." Also, you could add a little more description about the trees or the lake. For example, "It has lots of tall trees and a beautiful lake in the center." or "It's quite spacious and features a large lake surrounded by numerous trees."
*   **"There are also benches and walking paths."**: Good. Simple description of amenities.
*   **"I usually go there to walk or run."**: Clear and common activities. You could add *how often* you go or *how long* you walk/run for more detail.
*   **"Sometimes I meet my friend there and we talk."**: "my friend" could be "a friend" or "my friends" if you meet different people. "we talk" is a bit simple. You could say "we chat for a while" or "we catch up on things" or mention *where* you talk (e.g., "we usually sit on a bench and talk").
*   **"I like this park because it is quiet and beautiful."**: Good reasons for liking the park. "Quiet and beautiful" is a nice description.
*   **"It is a good place to relax."**: Good concluding sentence that summarizes your feeling about the park.

**Overall Feedback:** Your answer is easy to understand and directly addresses the questions. To get a higher score, try to:
1.  Use correct subject-verb agreement (like "has" instead of "have").
2.  Add more descriptive adjectives and details (e.g., "tall trees," "beautiful lake," "spacious park").
3.  Vary your sentence structure. Most of your sentences start with "It is" or "I". Try combining ideas or using different connectors.
4.  Expand on your activities or feelings with a little more detail (e.g., how long you walk, what you talk about with your friend, how relaxing it feels).

Keep practicing adding these details and varying your language!
