Question 
If your son, your 16-year-old son, let's say, says, "Dad, I want to start smoking." What would you do? What would you say?

Answer 
우리 아들은 16살 전에 할 거야. 아니, 그 전에 줄 거야, 내가. 먼저. 왜냐면 경험을 해 보라고.

Feedback 
The feedback focuses on the word "experience" and related concepts. Pronunciation tip for "experience" is given, suggesting a "ㅃ" sound for 'p'. Different ways to express letting someone experience something are shown: "I'm going to let him experience it," "I'm going to let him experience it for himself," and "I'm going to let him experience it first hand." The concept of "first hand" (direct) and "second hand" (indirect, also meaning "used") is explained, especially in the context of smoke. Different levels of expressing experience (from simple "I went to Canada" to "I have first hand knowledge") are demonstrated. Finally, shadowing practice is provided for phrases from the answer, such as "My son's going to try it before he turns 16" and "I want him to know what it's truly like."
