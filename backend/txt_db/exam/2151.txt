Question 
Explain 찝쩍하게. What is that? So are you saying that sometimes personal trainers they flirt?

Answer 
찝쩍대다. Flirting. 아, 내가 겪은 건 아니지만 그냥 좀 이렇게 괜히 불필요한 터치를 한다던가. 아니면 아무튼 쓸데없이 뭐 연락을 한다던가 뭔가 그런 게 있겠지.

Feedback 
You correctly identified '찝쩍대다' as 'Flirting'. Your explanation of unnecessary touch or contact is accurate. The model translation for your explanation is: "I personally never really experienced it myself. If he starts using my number to hit on me." This introduces 'hitting on' as another common phrase.
