Question 
N/A (General OPIc Strategy)

Answer 
N/A

Feedback 
To boost your OPIc score (especially for IH/AL), you can use the phrase 'flirted with the idea of' to express considering or hesitating about an idea or decision. For example, instead of 'I decided to go to Canada', you could say 'I flirted with the idea of going to Canada'. Another example is 'Rachel flirted with the idea of quitting her job'. This shows more complex sentence structure and vocabulary.
