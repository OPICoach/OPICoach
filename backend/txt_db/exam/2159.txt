Question 
Tell me about a foreign country you visited when you were young. What was special about that visit? What do you remember doing?

Answer 
Okay, let me tell you about a foreign country I visited. Actually, I went to Vietnam recently with my wife. And it was really, really good. The reason was that everything was so cheap. Everything was so cheap. So, you know, when we went to Vietnam, we could go to any restaurant, and it was all cheap. So we just ate like pigs everywhere we went. And even for the hotel, we went to a five-star hotel because, surprisingly, it was so cheap. So, you know what? We didn't have to worry about the money. We simply pulled the trigger. We didn't have to think about it. You know, we just used our credit card and decided to stay for a full week. The only thing we had to worry about was whether we should stay for one more week. So yeah, we simply pulled the trigger and decided to enjoy our time there.

Excellent use of the Past Experience strategy to answer the question about visiting a foreign country. You provided specific details like where you went (Vietnam), who you went with (wife), and what was special (everything was cheap). You effectively incorporated the idiom "pulled the trigger". You followed the recommended strategy of using the idiom and then immediately explaining its meaning in context ("We didn't have to worry about the money," "We just used our credit card"). This makes your use of the idiom clear and natural, enhancing your response.
