Question 
Have you ever had a special experience when you were on the phone? When was it? Who were you talking with? Tell me what happened.

Answer 
Well, actually, I love the England Premier League. So, at night, during watching the playing the soccer, I called with my friends. Yeah, it was so exciting and yeah, exciting. Maybe it was recent. My friend and I were crazy about soccer. So, whenever we talked about the soccer topic, I was so excited and I was so late. Yeah, that's pretty much it.

Feedback 
The first sentence took 10 seconds, which is within a reasonable standard (8-12 seconds per sentence). However, the second sentence took 28 seconds (38 seconds from the start), which is too long. This length is due to hesitation, repetition, and attempts to correct grammatical errors like 'in night' (should be 'at night'), 'during watching the playing the soccer', 'I playing the soccer', and 'called with my friends'. The student struggles with simple sentence structure and makes it longer by trying to fix mistakes, lowering the answer quality. Repeating words like 'exciting' and awkward phrasing like 'I was so late' also impact the flow and clarity. Focusing on simpler sentences around 10 seconds and avoiding self-correction attempts for minor errors is needed for IH.
