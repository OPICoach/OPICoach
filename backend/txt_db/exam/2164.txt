Question 
Tell me everything you did from the moment you arrived at the park to the time you left.

Answer 
The park was very small. Okay, I wanted to walk around. Maybe take a picture. That was the plan.

Feedback 
This is a good start for an I am level answer, but it's too general. To improve, you need a 'main point' and then specific details. The body part should start generally and then become more specific. For IH, add detail about the moment of arrival, like 'When I got to the park'. For AL, use more sophisticated vocabulary like 'arrived' instead of 'got to'. You can also add transitions like 'Now, when we arrived' and extra details like 'the park itself'. Using words like 'expectations' is also good. Practice using vocabulary for emotions like 'moves', 'emotion', 'fills me with great emotion' (for positive feelings), 'incredibly moving', 'anxious', 'it makes me anxious', 'stressful', 'anxiety', and 'causes me great anxiety' (for negative feelings). Pay attention to pronunciation differences like 'fills' vs 'feels'. Understanding the slight difference between 'nervous' and 'anxious' can also help.
