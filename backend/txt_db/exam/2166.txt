Question 
What are some holidays in your country? What do people do during these holidays? What is special about them?

Answer 
The recommended strategy for this I hate you set 14 (non-time comparison) question is to choose two holidays (e.g., Buddha's Birthday and Christmas) and compare them. Start with a general main point (simple, under 20 seconds) introducing the two holidays and perhaps a simple reason for liking them. Then, dedicate a section to Holiday A (e.g., Christmas), describing it without mentioning Holiday B. Next, dedicate a section to Holiday B (e.g., Buddha's Birthday), describing it and allowing for slight comparison back to Holiday A. Conclude the response. The answer should focus on what 'people' or 'Koreans' do and feel, rather than solely on personal actions.

This question falls under the I hate you set 14, requiring a comparison strategy (non-time). A general main point is sufficient, focusing on 'what' and keeping it simple and short (under 20 seconds) to save content for the comparison body. Choose two holidays; avoid common ones like 설날/추석 for uniqueness, but also avoid overly complex ones like Independence Day which are hard to handle naturally. Recommended choices are Buddha's Birthday and Christmas due to their manageability and distinctness. When describing Holiday A, do not mention Holiday B. When describing Holiday B, you can 'bounce' back slightly to Holiday A for comparison, which makes the comparison more powerful. Use collective pronouns like 'people' or 'Koreans' more than just 'I'. Being unique in topic choice helps, and avoid sounding like a pre-written script.
