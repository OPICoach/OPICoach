Question 
Tell me about the gym you used to go to in the past. What was it like? What kinds of facilities were there? How was it different from the gym you go to these days?

Answer 


Feedback 
The instructor believes this question might be an error or misremembered by the student, suggesting a more typical question would be general (e.g., 'tell me about the gyms in the past') rather than directly personal in this question set ('I hate you set'). The instructor also discusses the vocabulary 'facilities' and 'amenities', noting they are similar and often interchangeable, though 'facilities' can sometimes lean towards building structure and 'amenities' towards services for comfort/convenience. Both can apply to buildings.
