The instructor emphasizes the importance of understanding the term 'appliances' and distinguishing it from 'electronics' and 'furniture'. Appliances use electricity but are not for entertainment (e.g., microwave, washing machine, iron). Electronics are for entertainment (e.g., TV, laptop, smartphone) and should not be mentioned when asked about appliances. Furniture (e.g., sofa, chair, desk) generally lacks electricity. Answering with electronics or furniture for an appliance question will result in a low score. For comparison questions like this, the main point strategy is 'Pure present', meaning the answer should focus on the present state without immediately comparing to the past in the opening sentence. The instructor demonstrates using the 'What-Feeling-Why' and 'What-Why-Feeling' variations of the main point strategy with the example of a microwave, stressing the importance of including the 'why' part and practicing both variations.
