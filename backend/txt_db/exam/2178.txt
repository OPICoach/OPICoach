Feedback 
Okay, let's stop there. All right. So, I mean, it's getting there. All right. Now we know that she's talking about Central Park. That's good. Okay. But there was another point there that was crucial. It was very important, which was it was during the winter. Oh. So, you know, even though it was cold, you know, you could have said that, you know what? It was cold, but we felt warm anyway because, you know, we loved each other or blah, blah, blah, okay? Uh, you could be talking like that. And she was saying that this was our first time experience or whatever. The main point, like I said, it has to be very clear. So, we're going to try this again. This time, Haley, you are the main point person and then we're going to go back to Hyojung as continuing the answer. I'm going to change the question a little bit, okay? We only have like two minutes left. Uh, let's talk about bars, okay? Randomly. Okay. So, I'm going to give you guys a challenge. You didn't expect this. Uh, but let's try it. Haley, you're going to be talking about the bar experience and then Hyojung will continue. Okay? Okay. So, let me go ahead. Haley, I'm going to ask you a bar question, okay? Um, tell me about your experience recently at a bar. Tell me everything that happened.
