Question 
You've indicated in the survey that you like to go to the beach. Tell me about a beach that you like to go to. What does this place look like?

Answer 
All right, so there's this beach that I really like to go to. And why do I like that beach? Um, because, you know, it's really it's a perfect place for surfing. Um, I love surfing. Of course, there are a lot of other things, other good things about these speech. Uh, for example, there are a lot of ocean view cafes and so you can enjoy a cup of coffee and um, you can also enjoy the beautiful scenery out there at the same time. And you know, the people there are also, you know, awesome. I think they're, uh, most of them, they're tourists and they're all fashionable and nice and so, um, it's really enjoyable to talk with them. But I think the main reason that I really like to go to the beach is surfing. Yeah. Because, you know, it has big waves all the time. Mhm, and so, whenever I surf there, I feel like I became a pro surfer. And so, it feels really nice and I love that feeling. Um, you know, I have a lot of, uh, surfing experiences at another at different, uh, beaches, but I realized that this beach is the best. Yeah. And so that's why I really like this page. especially for surfing.

Feedback 
The question asks for a description of a beach you like, focusing on what the place looks like. This is a description category question. An initial IH answer was criticized for being unorganized and having complicated content. A second attempt was better focused but still lacked organization. The AL student's answer demonstrates a SMART structure (S-M-A-R-T) and uses several effective techniques:
1.  **Strong Start (S):** Begins with a simple, natural pattern "There's this beach..." and immediately states the main point (S) using self-questioning ("And why do I like that beach?") which makes it easy to follow.
2.  **Multiple Points (M):** Provides diverse examples (M1: ocean view cafes, M2: people/fashion/interaction). Talking about people is a natural topic for describing outside places.
3.  **Advanced Linking:** Connects ideas smoothly, e.g., linking enjoying coffee at a cafe with enjoying the view "at the same time." This adds complexity and flow.
4.  **Vocabulary Use:** Uses both simple words like "nice" effectively and slightly more advanced variations like "enjoyable" alongside "enjoy." Shows flexibility.
5.  **Varying Word Forms:** Uses the same root word in different forms ("feels nice" and "love that feeling") which sounds natural and sophisticated without using difficult vocabulary.
6.  **Transition & Return (A):** Uses a clear transition ("But I think the main reason...") to return to and reinforce the main point (A - Surfing is the best). Using "main reason" is a simple but effective way to highlight the primary point.
7.  **Realization/Reflection (R):** Includes a reflection comparing this beach to others and stating a realization ("I realized that this beach is the best"). This comparison and evaluative element is crucial for AL.
8.  **Simple Conclusion (T):** Ends with a clear summary statement ("That's why I really like this beach") and reinforces the main point again ("especially for surfing").
9.  **Natural Delivery:** Pauses and slight hesitations (like "another at different") are natural and do not negatively impact the score; they make the answer sound authentic.
10. **Pronunciation:** Remember to pronounce "beach" with a long 'e' sound (not like "bitch") and "people" correctly (not "paul").
Overall, the AL answer is easy to follow, well-organized, uses simple language effectively, incorporates diverse points, and includes AL-level elements like reflection and comparison.
