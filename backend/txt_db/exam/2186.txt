Question 
You indicated in the survey that you listen to music. What kind of music do you listen to? Who are some of your favorite musicians or composers?

Answer 
A student's answer is described, starting with fillers ('와우', '음', '야'), saying 'I really like the music', mentioning a singer '박상철', describing the genre as 'trot' and 'Korean traditional music', and saying 'You can feel the very exciting' when listening.

Feedback 
Fillers like '와우', '음' are acceptable for natural flow, but avoid '야'. Correct 'the music' to 'music'. 'I really like listening to music' is often more natural than 'I really like music'. Introduce a favorite singer smoothly, e.g., 'My favorite singer' or 'One of my favorite singers'. If mentioning a Korean name, explain it's a Korean name or use an easy, made-up English name (e.g., 'Blue Jacket'). Choose a genre that is easy to explain, like 'Pop', instead of 'Trot'. Use more appropriate words for 'exciting' when describing upbeat music, such as 'upbeat' or 'energetic'. Apply the MP+2 strategy: Start with the main point (favorite singer/genre), add +1 (briefly mention other genres/singers), and add +1 (return to the main point, explaining why the favorite is preferred). Aim for 30-40 seconds.
