Question 
how have the types of appointments you make changed over time? Where did you used to go for your appointments and where do you usually go now?

Answer 
The provided text does not contain a single, complete student answer. Instead, it presents example sentence structures typical of different OPIc levels (IM, IH, AL) for the initial part of the answer (focusing on the present).

Feedback 
The feedback focuses on comparing the characteristics of example sentences for different OPIc levels when answering the present tense part of the question:
- IM Level Example: "These days I make bank appointments because I need loans." + "And this is important to me because things are expensive."
  - Feedback: This level often uses relatively simple sentence structures and vocabulary. Frequency adverbs (like 'mainly', 'often') and quantifiers ('a lot of') are less common or absent. The second sentence is simple and directly states a reason.
- IH Level Example: "These days, I mainly make a lot of bank appointments because I often need loans."
  - Feedback: Compared to IM, IH speakers start incorporating more frequency adverbs ('mainly', 'often') and quantifiers ('a lot of'), adding more detail and nuance to their sentences. The sentence structure is slightly more complex than IM.
- AL Level Example: "I'd say these days I mainly make a lot of bank appointments because I often need loans to make big purchases."
  - Feedback: AL speakers demonstrate more advanced vocabulary and sentence structures. They often add extra details ('to make big purchases') that provide more context and specificity. They also tend to include phrases that express their opinion or thought process ('I'd say', 'I'd have to say'), making the response sound more natural and sophisticated. The use of 'a sense of', 'fills me with', and 'brings feelings of' patterns for expressing emotions (like 'contentment' or 'uncertainty') and idioms like 'butting heads over whether A or B' are also highlighted as advanced features that can boost scores by allowing the use of complex vocabulary and structures smoothly.
