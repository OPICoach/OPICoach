Feedback 
Your story is unique and believable, which is good. However, there are areas for improvement to reach a higher score like IH or AL.
1.  **Pacing & Naturalness:** Start slower, showing you are thinking (e.g., using 'um' for a slightly longer duration at the beginning). Speed up as you get more comfortable. Avoid starting too fast like a memorized script.
2.  **Opening Phrase:** Add 'a' to "quite tough questions" -> "quite a tough question". Practice using 'a' in such phrases (e.g., 'quite a good day'). Other natural opening phrases include "That's tough", "I didn't expect such a hard question", "That's not an easy question". Adding an exclamation like "Wow!" can make it sound more human.
3.  **Vocabulary/Grammar:** "boonies" should be "boonies" (needs 's'). "got flood" should be "got flooded" (needs 'ed' for past participle). "typhoon goes" should be in the past tense, like "typhoon went" or "the typhoon passed".
4.  **Phrasing:** Instead of "we had to go some school", a better phrase is "we were forced to go to a school nearby". Instead of "I didn't do anything" (meaning you couldn't do anything), use "I wasn't able to do anything" or "I couldn't do anything". "Wasn't able to" is a good phrase to practice.
5.  **Structure & Transitions:** State the main point (typhoon was bad because of flooding) clearly near the beginning. Continuously explain the 'why' â€“ why did you go to the school? Because it wasn't flooded, unlike your grandparents' house. Make these connections clear.
6.  **Direct Quotation:** If using direct quotation (like your father's words), keep it short. Do not pause after phrases like "I was like" or "he was like". Go directly into the quote (e.g., "my father was like don't worry").
7.  **Conclusion:** Have a clear concluding sentence to wrap up the story.
