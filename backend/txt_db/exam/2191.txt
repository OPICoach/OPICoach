Question 
Tell me about a place you like to visit.

Answer 
The good thing about Jeju is that it is so beautiful.

Feedback 
This answer uses a connected sentence structure ('The good thing about... is that...') which is characteristic of higher OPIc levels (IH and above), unlike simple sentences like 'I like Jeju. It is beautiful.' Using such structures helps demonstrate the ability to freely use connected sentences.
