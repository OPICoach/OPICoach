Question 
Describe a movie you recently watched.

Answer 
The good thing about the movie is that it is touching and moving.

Feedback 
Instead of just saying 'I liked the movie. It was touching.', this answer uses the 'The good thing about... is that...' structure to create a more complex and connected sentence, which is a key criterion for achieving an IH score.
