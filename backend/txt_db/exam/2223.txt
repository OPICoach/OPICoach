Overall: Excellent answer, the best heard from the student so far. Main Point (MP): 'I love pop because it's really exciting.' This is a strong MP, containing the topic (pop), feeling (love), and reason (exciting). It can be effectively stated in one sentence. Alternative expressions for 'exciting' like 'upbeat' or 'catchy' are also very useful. Past Tense (Grammar/Phrasing): 'When I was middle school days' should be 'When I was in my middle school days'. The phrase 'in my' and the plural 'days' are important for grammatical correctness. Pay attention to the 'S' grammar as it's crucial for improving from IH to AL. 'listen only classic' should be 'listen to classical music'. Use 'classical music' for this genre. For other genres like pop, rock, R&B, or hip hop, it's usually better to omit 'music' (e.g., just 'pop', 'rock'). Avoid 'trot' unless you can confidently explain it in English. 'my mom said it makes you clear. I mean makes your heart very calm down like those feeling.' can be improved to 'My mom always told me it'll calm my heart down.' 'It'll calm my heart down' is a good expression. 'Then my friends told me hey bro why don't you hear this? Try this' can be improved to 'Then all of a sudden, randomly, my friend introduced me to English pop.' 'All of a sudden' is a good alternative to 'suddenly' for OPIc. 'Randomly' adds detail. 'Introduced me to' is good phrasing. 'hey bro why don't you hear this? Try this' can also be expressed with 'hey check this out', which is a good, slightly informal phrase. Using expressions like 'holy shoot', 'holy moly', or 'holy cow' can add personality and emphasis. Present Tense: The present section should elaborate on the reason stated in the MP (e.g., why pop is energetic), continuing the theme from the MP. Comparison Strategy: The answer effectively uses the comparison strategy: MP (Present feeling/topic/reason), Past (Opposite of MP - e.g., classical music being less exciting), Present (Elaborate on MP). Showing contrast between past and present is key for comparison questions.
