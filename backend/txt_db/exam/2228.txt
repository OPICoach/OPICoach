Question 
Tell me about your experience riding a bicycle. Perhaps you can talk about a memorable time you went biking or describe your bike and how you use it.

Answer 
It's a used mountain bike with 24 gears. I usually go riding on my bike along the bank. I always wear my helmet when I ride my bike. My dad put two training wheels on the rear wheel so that I wouldn't fall down. Bicycles with four wheels don't go as fast as two-wheeled ones. He held my bike from the back until I could ride by myself. He showed me wounds he got from mountain biking. I decided to give it a try. Suddenly, a dog jumped in front of me and I had to slam on the brakes. I couldn't hear his owner calling out the dog's name.

Feedback 
Your answer provides a good mix of describing your bike and habits, and a specific memorable experience. Your vocabulary is good, and you use natural phrases like "slam on the brakes" and "give it a try." Most sentences are grammatically correct and easy to understand.

Specific Feedback:
- "I usually go riding on my bike along the bank": While understandable, "go riding on my bike" is a bit redundant. More natural options include "go cycling," "go for a ride on my bike," or simply "go riding my bike."
- "My dad put two training wheels on the rear wheel": Training wheels are typically attached to the frame near the rear axle, not directly "on the rear wheel." However, the meaning is clear.

Overall, this is a strong answer, especially the narrative part about the dog incident, which adds interesting detail.
