Question 
Tell me about your experience traveling overseas.

Answer 
My first international trip was to Canada. I had traveled to many different spots in Korea, but it was my first time traveling overseas. I had made my first passport as well because it was our first family vacation outside Korea. I don't know why my dad chose Canada as our first destination. I always try to pack light when I travel. Having a heavy or big suitcase actually could be a big hassle. I also pack an emergency medical kit whenever I travel. I'd like to travel there because I want to see pyramids and other ancient buildings. I've always had an admiration for Egypt. When I get there, I would like to take pictures of the great ancient architecture.
