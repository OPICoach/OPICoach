Question 
Tell me about your favorite way to exercise, or perhaps tell me about your experience with jogging.

Answer 
I don't need a companion to jog because I just like running and listening to music. I like running on the treadmill. When I jog, I need a good pair of running shoes. Also, I apply sunscreen before jogging. I decided to jog because I was gaining weight. I jog because I want to keep in shape. I thought skipping exercise would make me more tired. I turned around and ran back home, but I was already soaked in the heavy rain. I learned that I should check the weather before jogging.

Feedback 
Overall, your answer is well-structured and covers various aspects of your jogging experience, including your motivation, preparation, and a memorable incident. Your sentences are grammatically correct, and you use appropriate vocabulary like 'companion,' 'keep in shape,' and 'soaked.' The story about the rain is a good addition and demonstrates your ability to use past tense effectively. The sentence 'I thought skipping exercise would make me more tired' is grammatically correct but feels slightly disconnected from the specific topic of jogging; consider linking it more clearly or focusing on aspects directly related to your jogging routine. To make your answer even richer, you could add more details, such as how often you jog, your favorite music for running, or how jogging makes you feel.
