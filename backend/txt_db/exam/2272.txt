Question 
Can you tell me about your exercise routine or going to the gym? What do you usually do there?

Answer 
저는 일주일에 적어도 세 번은 운동을 하기 위해 체육관에 갑니다. I go to a gym at least three times a week to work out. 제가 처음 운동을 시작했을 때 저는 매우 피곤했습니다. When I first started to work out, I was extremely tired. 헬스장에 가는 주된 목적은 건강을 유지하는 것입니다. The main purpose of going to a gym is to stay fit. 저는 어렸을 때 약간 과체중이었어요. I was a little overweight when I was a kid. 살을 빼는 것은 쉽지 않았습니다. 그래서 운동을 빼먹지 않아요. It was not easy to lose weight, so I never miss my workout. 제가 다니는 헬스장에는 운동 기구들이 많이 있습니다. The gym I go to has a lot of exercise equipment. 웨이트 트레이닝을 제대로 하기 위해서 자주 어려움을 겪습니다. I often have difficulties because in order to do weight training properly. 보는 사람이 없을 때 아령을 떨어뜨리지도 모릅니다. Without anyone spotting you, you might drop the dumbbell. 헬스장에서는 스트레칭을 먼저 하기 때문에 운동 중에 다치지 않습니다. At the gym, I first do stretch, so I won't get hurt during my workout. 달리기가 끝나면 근육을 키우기 위해 웨이트 트레이닝을 해요. After I'm done with running, I do weight training to build up some muscles.

Feedback 
Your answer is clear and directly addresses the topic of your gym routine. You provide good details about why you go, what you do, and some challenges. Here are a few points for improvement:

1.  **Sentence Structure (Incomplete Sentence):** The sentence "I often have difficulties because in order to do weight training properly." is incomplete. It starts with 'because' but doesn't finish the thought (e.g., '...because in order to do weight training properly, you need a spotter'). You could combine it with the next sentence or rephrase.
    *   *Suggestion:* "I often have difficulties doing weight training properly. For example, without anyone spotting you, you might drop the dumbbell." or "I often have difficulties doing weight training properly because without anyone spotting you, you might drop the dumbbell."
2.  **Word Choice (Starting):** "When I first started to work out" is grammatically correct, but "When I first started working out" is slightly more common and natural.
    *   *Suggestion:* Use "started working out".
3.  **Word Choice (Stretching):** "I first do stretch" should be "I first do stretching" or simply "I first stretch". 'Stretch' is the verb, 'stretching' is the noun form often used after 'do'.
    *   *Suggestion:* Use "I first do stretching" or "I first stretch".
4.  **Verb Tense/Phrasing (Avoiding Injury):** "so I won't get hurt during my workout" is understandable. For describing a general routine or preventative measure, "so I don't get hurt" or "to avoid getting hurt" might sound slightly more natural.
    *   *Suggestion:* Consider "so I don't get hurt" or "to avoid getting hurt".

Overall, your English is very good and easy to understand. Focusing on completing sentences and choosing the most natural phrasing for common actions will help you sound even more fluent.
