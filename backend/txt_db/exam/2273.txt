Question 
Tell me about your experience with swimming.

Answer 
I once won the race in the women's 100 meter freestyle. I know all the strokes and my favorite stroke is freestyle. My mom signed me up for swimming lessons at a sports center. He actually was a really good swimmer and I learned from him a lot. I think of him as a great instructor, but I'm still a little scared of him. Indoor pools were boring. So I asked my parents to take me to the beach. My mom made me wear a life jacket. I got very tired and had no energy to swim, and of course I was pretty far from the shore. I started to drown and I was so scared. It was the scariest thing ever. And since then, I don't really like to swim in the ocean.
