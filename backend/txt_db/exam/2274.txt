Question 
Tell me about your favorite actor or movie, or describe your experience going to the movies.

Answer 
My favorite actor is Matt Damon. He actually becomes the character and it's so believable. He studied for his undergraduate degree at Harvard and he even writes scenarios. I usually go to the theater in my neighborhood. It's very big with lots of screenings, so I can always watch a movie whenever I want. At the theater, I get my tickets from the ticket booth. I never let my friend talk because it really distracts me. I checked from the internet to see what's recently been released. I wanted to see the film because I had read quite good compliments on the movie. The actress Natalie Portman also won the Best Actress Oscar.

Feedback 
Your answer is well-structured and covers different aspects related to movies, including your favorite actor, his background, your movie-going habits, and a recent movie experience. This shows good fluency.

Here is some specific feedback:

*   "He actually becomes the character and it's so believable.": This is a good description. You could also say "He really embodies the character" or "He gets completely into the role." "It's so believable" is perfect.
*   "He studied for his undergraduate degree at Harvard and he even writes scenarios.": "Studied for his undergraduate degree at Harvard" is correct. For writing movies, "screenplays" or "scripts" is more common than "scenarios."
*   "I usually go to the theater in my neighborhood.": Natural and correct.
*   "It's very big with lots of screenings, so I can always watch a movie whenever I want.": "Lots of screenings" is good. The whole sentence flows well and is grammatically correct.
*   "At the theater, I get my tickets from the ticket booth.": Correct and clear.
*   "I never let my friend talk because it really distracts me.": This is a very natural way to say this. Good use of "distracts me."
*   "I checked from the internet to see what's recently been released.": "Checked online" or "checked the internet" sounds a bit more natural than "checked from the internet." "What's recently been released" is perfect.
*   "I wanted to see the film because I had read quite good compliments on the movie.": Instead of "compliments on the movie," it's more common to say "read good reviews," "heard good things about the movie," or "read positive comments/feedback." "Quite good" is fine. The use of "had read" is acceptable, simple past "read" would also work here.
*   "The actress Natalie Portman also won the Best Actress Oscar.": This is a correct sentence, but it feels a little disconnected from the rest of your answer about Matt Damon and your movie-going habits. If she was in the movie you just mentioned, you could connect it by saying, "The movie I saw starred [Actor's Name] and Natalie Portman, who recently won the Best Actress Oscar." If not, it's just an extra piece of information that doesn't quite fit the flow.

Overall, your English is very good and easy to understand. Keep practicing!
