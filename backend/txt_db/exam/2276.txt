Question 
fashion styles are always changing. Tell me about the different kinds of clothes that were popular when you were younger. What did the styles look like? How were they different from what is popular now?

Answer 
I find that fashion these days is all about bold colors. They make outfits look fresh while drawing attention effortlessly.

Feedback 
This is the P (Present your main point) part of the PERFECT strategy. The main point is about bold colors in modern fashion. The sentence 'They make outfits look fresh while drawing attention effortlessly' provides a reason and adds emotion (effortlessly). The strategy involves presenting a single main point (bold colors) first. Connected sentences are better than single sentences for flow.
