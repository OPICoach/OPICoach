Question 
Stories about recycling are often in the media. Tell me about one news story that you heard related to recycling or perhaps the environment. Describe what the story was about and what the reaction to the story was.

Answer 
Um, in the media, I don't really know much about recycling in the media, but um, I know my recycling habits have gotten better here in Korea. Um, my my landlord uh really begged me to recycle. Cuz I wasn't before. And so, um, yeah, now I separate all the things and uh I guess it creates a more more uh required and necessary cuz now there are fines. But one of my friends did like we find it really weird when um the CCTV takes pictures of people who don't recycle. And and they took a picture of him not recycling and they put it on his door. And like you can't really see him cuz he's covered up with all these jackets, but somehow his his uh landlord knew it was him. And that's just like really shocking to know. Koreans are hardcore. Thank you. That's it. The end, the end.

Feedback 
The student effectively handled a difficult question by pivoting away from the 'news story' aspect to discuss personal recycling habits. The phrase "I don't really know much about..." is a good way to acknowledge the question while stating a lack of specific knowledge on that topic. By using "my recycling habits," the student successfully controlled the direction of the answer, shifting the focus to a more manageable topic (habits). This strategy of being honest about not knowing a specific news story and instead talking about a related personal habit is highly effective and natural in a conversational test like OPIc. The student used a 'quick comparison strategy' by briefly mentioning past habits ("Cuz I wasn't before") before describing current ones ("now I separate all the things"). This adds context and makes the current habit explanation more meaningful. Explaining the 'why' behind the improved habit ("cuz now there are fines") is good, and illustrating it with a personal story about a friend makes the answer engaging. Using phrases like "we find it really weird" effectively conveys feeling and makes the language sound smooth and natural. The use of "find it" to mean 'think it is' is a useful expression. Although there might have been a slight imprecision in describing the friend's situation ("covered up with all these jackets"), the student wisely prioritized the natural flow and clear message of the story over perfect grammatical correction, which is a key skill in communication. The use of the word "shocking" effectively expresses the feeling related to the friend's story. Including feelings in answers makes them more impactful and relatable. The concluding phrase "Koreans are hardcore" is a native-like expression that adds a strong, memorable closing statement, used here to describe something intense or surprising.
