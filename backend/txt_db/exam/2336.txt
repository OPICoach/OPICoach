Question 
Music preference / Listening habits

Answer 
Interested in music, usually like ballads, sometimes listen to upbeat music when working out or driving.

Feedback 
While liking ballads is fine, the specific combination of liking ballads and listening to upbeat music *when working out or driving* is a widely known problematic answer. It is considered a rehearsed or recited answer by the OPIc test administrators and can lead to a penalty (NH grade). Avoid using this specific scenario.
