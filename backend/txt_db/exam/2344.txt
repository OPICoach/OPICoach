Question 
Community event / Recycling / Childhood memory

Answer 
Recycling as a community event, getting candy as a child from the person collecting recycling.

Feedback 
This is a widely known problematic answer, especially the mention of getting candy while recycling. It is considered a rehearsed or recited answer by the OPIc test administrators and can lead to a penalty (NH grade). Avoid using this specific scenario.
