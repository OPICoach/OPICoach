You've indicated that you like to go to the beach. Tell me about a beach that you like to go to. What does this place look like? What kinds of things do you like to do when you go to the beach? Tell me about the activities you typically do when you go to the beach.

Answer 
Yes, I love the beach! My favorite one is a place called 'Sunset Bay'. It's a bit secluded, with soft, golden sand and clear, blue water. There are some rocky outcrops at one end, and palm trees line the back of the beach, providing some shade. When I go there, I usually start by finding a nice spot to lay out my towel. I love swimming in the ocean, the water is just perfect. Sometimes I'll read a book, or just lie there listening to the waves. If I'm with friends, we might play some beach games like frisbee. Watching the sunset from there is also a must-do activity.
