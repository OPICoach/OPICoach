Question 
What kinds of clothes do people in your country typically wear? Are there different clothes for work and for play? Tell me about the clothes in your country. What kinds of clothes do you like to wear personally? What are you wearing today? What kind of fashion style do you like? Give me all the details about your fashion style. I would like to know how people dress in your country. What kinds of clothes do they wear for work or play?

Answer 
People in my country wear a wide variety of clothes, depending on the occasion, weather, and personal style. Yes, there are definitely different clothes for work and play. For work, people typically wear business attire – suits, blouses, dress shirts, and trousers or skirts. It's generally more formal. For leisure or 'play', clothing is much more casual – jeans, t-shirts, sneakers, comfortable dresses. My personal style is quite casual and comfortable. I like wearing jeans, simple tops, and cardigans or jackets. I'm not really into following trends. Today, I'm wearing a pair of dark blue jeans and a grey t-shirt. My fashion style is probably best described as minimalist and practical. I prefer quality over quantity and clothes that are easy to mix and match.

Feedback 
You effectively address the different parts of this multi-faceted question. You clearly distinguish between work and casual wear and describe your personal style well. Using terms like 'business attire', 'leisure', 'minimalist', and 'practical' is effective. You could add a sentence about how weather influences clothing choices or mention specific popular brands if you wanted to add more detail.
