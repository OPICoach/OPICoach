Answer 
Eating healthy is definitely a focus for many. Healthy foods include things like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. They are healthy because they provide essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and energy while being low in unhealthy fats and sugars. As for popular dishes in my country, one typical meal is [mention a specific dish, e.g., Bibimbap]. It's a mixed rice dish with various vegetables, meat, and a spicy sauce. It's special because it's very customizable and offers a good balance of different food groups. To shop for healthy food, I usually stick to the outer aisles of the supermarket where fresh produce, meat, and dairy are. I read labels to check for sugar and fat content. Cooking healthy food often involves steaming, baking, or grilling instead of frying, and using less salt and oil. On a regular day, I might have oatmeal with fruit for breakfast, a salad with chicken for lunch, and for dinner, perhaps grilled fish with steamed vegetables and brown rice. I also try to snack on nuts or yogurt.
