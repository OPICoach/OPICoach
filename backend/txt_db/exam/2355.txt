I would like to now talk about where you live. What is your favorite room in your home? What does it look like?

Answer 
Okay, I live in an apartment building in a residential area. My apartment is on the third floor. It's not huge, but it's comfortable. From the outside, the building is made of brick and has balconies. My apartment has three rooms: a living room, a bedroom, and a kitchen, plus a bathroom. The living room is the largest space; it has a sofa, a coffee table, a TV stand, and a bookshelf. The bedroom is simple, with a bed, a wardrobe, and a small desk. The kitchen is functional, with a stove, refrigerator, and cabinets. My favorite room is probably the living room. I like it because it's bright, thanks to the large window and balcony door, and it's where I relax, read, or watch movies. It feels cozy and is the main gathering space when I have a friend over.

Feedback 
You provide a good, detailed description of your home and its rooms. You clearly state the number of rooms and describe the key features of each. Identifying your favorite room and explaining *why* you like it adds a personal touch. Using descriptive words like 'residential area', 'spacious', 'functional', and 'cozy' is effective. Ensure smooth flow between describing the overall apartment and then focusing on individual rooms.
