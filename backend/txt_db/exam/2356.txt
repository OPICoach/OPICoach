What is your normal routine at home? What things do you usually do on weekdays and what kinds of things do you do on weekends? What is your normal routine at home? What things do you usually do during the weekdays? What kinds of things do you do on the weekend? What kinds of things do you do to keep your house clean and comfortable? What kinds of housework do you do at home? Tell me about your normal routine at home. What do you do on weekdays and on weekends?

Answer 
My normal routine varies slightly between weekdays and weekends. On weekdays, my routine is quite structured. I usually wake up around 7 AM, get ready, have a quick breakfast, and then head to work. In the evening, after work, I might exercise, cook dinner, or spend some time reading or watching something. I usually go to bed around 11 PM. Weekends are more flexible. I usually sleep in a bit later, maybe until 9 AM. I often use the weekends to do housework, like cleaning the apartment, doing laundry, and grocery shopping. I also like to meet up with friends, pursue hobbies, or just relax at home without a strict schedule. To keep my house clean, I try to do a little bit each day, like washing dishes and tidying up, but I save bigger tasks like vacuuming and cleaning the bathroom for the weekend. Keeping it comfortable involves things like making sure it's tidy, having fresh air, and maybe lighting a candle.

Feedback 
You provide a clear and well-organized description of your weekday and weekend routines. You effectively contrast the structured weekdays with the more flexible weekends. You also integrate the information about housework and keeping your home comfortable naturally within the routine description. Good use of time expressions like 'around 7 AM', 'in the evening', and 'until 9 AM'. To improve, you could use more varied sentence structures, perhaps starting some sentences with adverbs or clauses.
