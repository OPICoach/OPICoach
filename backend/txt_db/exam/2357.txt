People use the internet for countless things these days. The most common activities include communicating via email and messaging apps, browsing social media, watching videos, online shopping, and searching for information. Many people also play online games, stream music, or use it for work and education, accessing online courses or doing research. Personally, I use the internet extensively every day. I check my emails, browse news websites, and use social media to keep up with friends and current events. I do quite a bit of online shopping; it's so convenient. I also watch a lot of videos. I typically watch videos for leisure, like documentaries, movie trailers, or educational content on topics I'm interested in, such as history or technology. I don't usually share videos myself, but I often watch videos that friends have shared. It's a huge part of modern life.

Feedback 
You provide a comprehensive overview of internet usage, both generally and personally. You list a good variety of online activities and explain your own habits clearly. Mentioning specific types of videos you watch adds good detail. Using phrases like 'countless things' and 'extensively every day' is effective. To enhance fluency, ensure smooth transitions between discussing general usage and your personal habits.
