Feedback 
You clearly state the types of movies you like and explain your reasons effectively. Choosing a favorite movie star and providing a brief background is good. Your attempt to include recent news is commendable, although fabricating specific news might be challenging. In a real OPIc, it's okay to say 'I haven't heard any recent news about him, but I admire his work in...' or talk about a past role. Using phrases like 'compelling stories', 'strong character development', and 'imaginative ideas' is good. Ensure the flow is smooth when transitioning from discussing genres to a specific actor and news.
