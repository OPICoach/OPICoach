Question 
You indicated in the survey that you listen to music. What kinds of music do you listen to? Who are some of your favorite musicians or composers? When and where do you usually go to listen to music? Do you listen to the radio? Do you go to concerts? Tell me about the different ways you enjoy music.

Answer 
Music is a big part of my life. I listen to a mix of genres, but I particularly enjoy pop, rock, and some classical music. Some of my favorite musicians include [Mention a musician, e.g., Adele] for her powerful vocals, and [Mention another, e.g., Coldplay] for their anthemic songs. I listen to music throughout the day. I usually listen at home while working or relaxing, or when I'm commuting, using my headphones. I mostly stream music through apps on my phone or computer. I don't listen to traditional radio much anymore, but I do enjoy going to live concerts when I have the chance. Seeing an artist perform live is a completely different and exciting experience. So, I enjoy music by streaming, listening with headphones, and occasionally attending concerts.

Feedback 
You provide a clear answer about your music preferences and listening habits. You mention specific genres and artists, which is good. You explain *when* and *where* you listen and the methods you use (streaming, headphones, concerts). Using phrases like 'a big part of my life' and 'completely different and exciting experience' adds expression. To improve, you could briefly describe the *feeling* music gives you or a specific memory related to music.
