Question 
Describe a memorable experience or a problem you encountered.

Answer 
Once, during a trip from New York City to London, my flight got canceled unexpectedly due to bad weather in London. It was a chaotic scene at the airport as passengers scrambled to find solutions. After a long wait, I managed to secure a seat on the next day's flight. I had to quickly arrange accommodation for the night and explore the city in the meantime. Despite the inconvenience, I made the most of it, enjoying the local cuisine and atmosphere. The following day, I finally boarded the flight to London, grateful to continue my journey. This experience taught me the importance of patience and resilience when dealing with unexpected travel challenges.
