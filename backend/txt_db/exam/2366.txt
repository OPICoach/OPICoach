Question 
Describe a memorable experience or a problem you encountered.

Answer 
Once, I was traveling to Paris for a business conference. However, upon arriving at the airport, I realized I had misread the departure time and I had missed my flight. Panicked, I quickly contacted the airline to explore my options. After some tense moments, they managed to rebook me on a later flight with a layover. I had to endure a longer journey with the layover, but eventually, I made it to Paris just in time for the conference. It was a stressful experience, but it taught me the importance of double-checking travel details and staying calm in unexpected situations.

Feedback 
Good use of past tense to narrate the event. Phrases like 'misread the departure time', 'Panicked', and 'tense moments' convey the feeling of the situation. 'Endure a longer journey' is well-phrased. The conclusion highlights practical lessons learned.
