Question 
Describe a memorable experience or a problem you encountered.

Answer 
During my stay at a hotel in Bangkok, I had a memorable experience when a sudden power outage occurred late at night. The entire hotel was plunged into darkness, leaving guests bewildered and uncertain. However, instead of feeling frustrated, the situation sparked an impromptu gathering in the lobby. Guests from various backgrounds shared stories, snacks, and even played acoustic music by candlelight. It was a unique bonding experience, turning a potential inconvenience into a heartwarming moment of connection. Eventually, the power was restored, but the camaraderie formed during that blackout remained a cherished memory, highlighting the unexpected joys of travel and human connection.

Feedback 
Engaging narrative about an unexpected event. Phrases like 'plunged into darkness', 'bewildered and uncertain', 'sparked an impromptu gathering' are descriptive. It effectively contrasts the initial problem with the positive outcome ('heartwarming moment of connection', 'camaraderie formed').
