Question 
Describe a memorable experience or a problem you encountered.

Answer 
Yes, I've experienced trouble due to unexpected weather. During a hiking trip in the mountains with friends, we encountered a sudden thunderstorm. As the rain intensified, we realized we were ill-prepared for the harsh conditions. Seeking shelter, we found a small cave to wait out the storm. Despite our discomfort and fear, we stayed calm and supported each other. We stayed close together, sharing snacks and stories to pass the time. Once the storm subsided, we carefully navigated our way back to safety, using rain gear and watching out for dangers. While the experience was challenging, it strengthened our bond and taught us the importance of being prepared and resilient in the face of nature's unpredictability.
