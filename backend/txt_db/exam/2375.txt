Question 
Describe a memorable experience or a problem you encountered.

Answer 
Yes, I once bought a digital camera online that arrived damaged. Upon opening the package, I noticed a crack on the camera lens, rendering it unusable. Disappointed, I immediately contacted the seller to report the issue and request a replacement or refund. They apologized for the inconvenience and offered to send a replacement camera free of charge. I carefully packaged the damaged camera and shipped it back to the seller. Within a few days, I received the replacement camera in perfect condition. Although the initial experience was frustrating, the seller's prompt response and willingness to rectify the situation restored my confidence in their service.

Feedback 
Well-described problem and resolution. Vocabulary like 'arrived damaged', 'rendering it unusable', 'rectify the situation' is precise. It shows a clear sequence of events from discovering the problem to receiving the replacement. The final sentence effectively summarizes the outcome and feeling.
