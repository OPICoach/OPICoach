Question 
Describe a memorable experience or a problem you encountered.

Answer 
Yes, I once left my phone behind at a cafe while meeting a friend for lunch. As we chatted and enjoyed our meal, I absentmindedly placed my phone on the table. After we finished eating, I got up to leave and completely forgot about my phone. It wasn't until I reached home that I realized it was missing. Panicked, I rushed back to the cafe, and thankfully, the staff had found my phone and kept it safe for me. It was a moment of relief and gratitude, but also a lesson learned about the importance of being mindful of my belongings, especially in public places.

Feedback 
Relatable problem clearly explained. Vocabulary like 'absentmindedly placed', 'completely forgot', 'Panicked' is effective. The resolution ('thankfully, the staff had found my phone') provides a positive outcome. The conclusion states a practical lesson learned.
