Question 
Describe a memorable experience or a problem you encountered.

Answer 
The food store I frequent is a local market called Fresh Harvest. I first discovered it when a friend recommended it to me, praising its wide selection of fresh produce and locally sourced goods. What sets Fresh Harvest apart is its commitment to supporting local farmers and artisans, offering a diverse array of organic fruits, vegetables, and artisanal products. From farm fresh eggs to homemade jams and cheeses, every item is carefully curated for quality and sustainability. The warm and inviting atmosphere, coupled with friendly staff, makes shopping at Fresh Harvest a delightful experience every time. Plus, knowing that my purchases support local businesses adds an extra layer of satisfaction to my shopping trips.

Feedback 
This answer describes a place rather than a specific experience. Good descriptive vocabulary is used, e.g., 'wide selection', 'locally sourced goods', 'diverse array', 'carefully curated', 'warm and inviting atmosphere', 'delightful experience'. It effectively explains why the place is favored.
