Question 
Describe a memorable experience or a problem you encountered.

Answer 
Once, I accidentally broke a vase while rearranging furniture in my living room. It was a delicate family heirloom, and I felt guilty and frustrated as it shattered into pieces. Taking a deep breath, I carefully gathered the fragments and assessed the damage. Despite my initial panic, I realized that I could fix the situation by repairing the vase. I researched online tutorials on how to mend broken ceramics and gathered the necessary supplies. With patience and determination, I carefully glued the pieces back together, taking care to ensure a seamless restoration. Although the vase showed signs of damage, the fixed version gained sentimental value and symbolized resilience and resourcefulness. The experience taught me the importance of embracing imperfections and finding beauty in the process of repair.
