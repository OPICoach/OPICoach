Question 
Describe a memorable experience or a problem you encountered.

Answer 
Yes, there was a time when I agreed to help organize a family gathering for my cousin's birthday party. However, because of unexpected work, I found myself unable to fulfill my promise. I felt guilty for letting my cousin down, especially since she had been counting on my assistance. Immediately, I reached out to her, explaining the situation and expressing my sincere apologies. Thankfully, she was understanding and reassured me that she had found alternative help for the event. My cousin's understanding and gracious response taught me the importance of communication and flexibility in maintaining strong relationships with loved ones.
