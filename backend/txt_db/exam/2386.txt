Question 
Describe a memorable experience or a problem you encountered.

Answer 
Yes, I once encountered a problem while shopping for a specific item at a department store. Despite checking the store's inventory online beforehand, I couldn't find the item I wanted on the shelves. Frustrated, I approached a store associate for assistance, only to learn that the item was out of stock. Disappointed, I explored alternative options and found a similar item at a neighboring store. However, I was taken aback by the high price tag. Determined not to overspend, I decided to wait for a sale or explore other retailers. Ultimately, I found a better deal online and purchased the item at a more affordable price. This experience taught me the importance of flexibility and patience when faced with shopping challenges, and the value of exploring different avenues to find the best solution.
