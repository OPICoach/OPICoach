Question 
Describe a memorable experience or a problem you encountered.

Answer 
I once encountered difficulty making vacation plans when trying to organize a trip with friends. We had different preferences and conflicting schedules, making it challenging to find a destination and dates that worked for everyone. After numerous discussions and compromises, we finally settled on a destination and travel dates that accommodated everyone's needs as best as possible. It required flexibility, open communication, and a willingness to compromise to ensure that everyone felt included and satisfied with the vacation plans. Despite the initial challenges, the collaborative effort resulted in a memorable and enjoyable trip for all involved.
