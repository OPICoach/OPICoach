Question 
Describe a memorable experience or a problem you encountered.

Answer 
Yes, I once had to perform a piano recital for a large audience but encountered a problem when the piano's sustain pedal malfunctioned midway through my performance. It was a nerve-racking moment as the sustained notes abruptly stopped, disrupting the flow of the piece. However, I remained composed and quickly adapted my playing technique to compensate for the lack of sustain. Despite the initial setback, I continued the performance with determination, focusing on maintaining the integrity of the music. Thankfully, the audience was understanding and supportive, and I managed to complete the piece without further interruption. This experience taught me the importance of remaining calm under pressure and improvising solutions to unexpected challenges during performances.
