Feedback 
The provided text is a lecture on OPIc strategies and does not contain specific feedback on a student's answer. It offers general advice for achieving IH/Advanced, including: 1. Speak in paragraphs (6+ sentences, min 30 seconds). 2. Master tenses (crucial for higher levels). 3. Prepare for unexpected questions (e.g., using phrases for location, building description, lobby details, water fountains). 4. Prepare for Role Play (complex questions for IM3, problem-solving for IH+). 5. Be detailed and talkative (provide examples and details, not just simple sentences).
