Question 
I'd like to give you a situation to act it out. You want to take your friend to the movies. Call the theater and ask three or four questions to get tickets for you and your friend.

Answer 
Hello, I'd like to buy two tickets for a movie. What movies are showing today? What are the showtimes for [Movie Title]? How much are two adult tickets?

Feedback 
'I'd like to buy two tickets...' is a polite way to start. 'What movies are showing today?' is a good opening question. 'What are the showtimes for [Movie Title]?' is specific and useful. 'How much are two adult tickets?' is a clear question about the price. Excellent questions.
