Question 
I'd like to give you a situation to act it out. You are planning on going on a trip. Call a travel agency and ask three or four questions about the trip you want to go on.

Answer 
Hi, I'm planning a trip to [Destination]. I have some questions. What is the best time to visit [Destination]? Can you recommend a good hotel? What activities are popular there?

Feedback 
'I'm planning a trip to [Destination]' sets the context well. 'What is the best time to visit [Destination]?' is a relevant question for trip planning. 'Can you recommend a good hotel?' is also very useful. 'What activities are popular there?' helps with planning the itinerary. Good questions for a travel agency.
