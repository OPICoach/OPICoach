Question 
I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. You want to take a trip within your own country. Call the travel agent and ask three or four questions to find out what you need.

Answer 
Hello, I want to plan a trip within Korea. What are some popular destinations for a short trip? Do you have any package deals? What kind of transportation is best?

Feedback 
'I want to plan a trip within Korea' is clear. 'What are some popular destinations...?' is a good way to get ideas. 'Do you have any package deals?' is a practical question about options. 'What kind of transportation is best?' is also very helpful for planning. Good questions.
