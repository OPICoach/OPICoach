Question 
I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. You have arrived in a new city and you're trying to find a hotel for tonight. Go to the reception desk of a hotel. Describe the room you want and ask three or four questions to get information about what is available.

Answer 
Hello, I'm looking for a room for one person for tonight. Do you have any rooms available? How much is a standard room? Does the room have free Wi-Fi?

Feedback
