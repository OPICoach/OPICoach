Question 
I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. You need to buy some clothes. Go to a clothing store and tell the salesperson about the piece of clothing you want to buy. Ask two to three questions about all the things you need to know about that type of clothing.

Answer 
Hi, I'm looking for a pair of jeans. I want something comfortable. What kind of fit is this? What is the material made of? How should I wash them?

Feedback 
'I'm looking for a pair of jeans. I want something comfortable' describes your need well. 'What kind of fit is this?' is a good question about style. 'What is the material made of?' is useful information. 'How should I wash them?' is a practical question about care. Good questions about clothing.
