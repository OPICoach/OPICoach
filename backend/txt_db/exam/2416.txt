Question 
I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. You see a sign at your favorite store that says that they are having a big sale. Go to the store and ask three or four questions to get as much information as possible about the sale.

Answer 
Excuse me, I saw the sign about the big sale. What items are included in the sale? How long does the sale last? Is there an extra discount for members?

Feedback 
'Excuse me, I saw the sign about the big sale' clearly states your reason for asking. 'What items are included...?' is essential to know what's discounted. 'How long does the sale last?' is important for timing. 'Is there an extra discount for members?' is a good question about potential additional savings. Excellent questions for a sale.
