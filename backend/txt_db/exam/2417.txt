Question 
I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. Your friend tells you about a great sale happening at one of you favorite stores. Ask your friend three or four questions to find out as much as you can about the sale.

Answer 
Wow, a sale at [Store Name]? That's great! What kind of things are on sale? How much is the discount? When does it end?

Feedback 
'Wow, a sale at [Store Name]? That's great!' shows enthusiasm, which is good in a conversation with a friend. 'What kind of things are on sale?' and 'How much is the discount?' are key details. 'When does it end?' is important for planning. Good questions for a friend.
