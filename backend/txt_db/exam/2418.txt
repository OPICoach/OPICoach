Question 
I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. There is a newly opened store. Call your friend who knows about the new store and ask some questions about the store to get some information.

Answer 
Hey, I heard about that new store that opened. What kind of store is it? Have you been there? Is it expensive?

Feedback 
'Hey, I heard about that new store...' is a natural way to start a conversation with a friend. 'What kind of store is it?' asks about the type of store. 'Have you been there?' asks for their experience. 'Is it expensive?' is a practical question about price range. Good, informal questions.
