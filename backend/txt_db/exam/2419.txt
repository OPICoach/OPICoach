Question 
I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. Your friend told you about a food store that he or she goes to. Call your friend and ask about the food store to get some information.

Answer 
Hi [Friend's Name], you told me about that food store you like. What's special about it? Do they have fresh produce? Is it far from my place?

Feedback 
'Hi [Friend's Name], you told me about that food store...' reminds your friend of the topic. 'What's special about it?' asks for the unique points. 'Do they have fresh produce?' is a common concern for food stores. 'Is it far from my place?' is a practical question about location relative to you. Good questions.
