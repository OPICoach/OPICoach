Question 
I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. You are planning a vacation with a friend. Call the travel agency and describe the kind of vacation you and your friend are planning. Then, ask three or four questions to find out what you need to know to complete the plans for this vacation.

Answer 
Hello, my friend and I are planning a relaxing beach vacation for about a week next month. We're looking for a place with nice beaches and good food. Can you recommend some destinations? Do you have any all-inclusive packages? What is the average cost for this type of trip?

Feedback 
Describing the type of vacation ('relaxing beach vacation', 'nice beaches and good food') is a great start. 'Can you recommend some destinations?' is a good question to get options. 'Do you have any all-inclusive packages?' asks about specific types of deals. 'What is the average cost...?' is essential for budgeting. Excellent questions.
