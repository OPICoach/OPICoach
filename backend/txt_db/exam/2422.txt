Question 
I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. You are planning to visit a friend who is living in a different country. Ask your friend three or four questions about the geography of his or her country.

Answer 
Hey [Friend's Name], I'm excited to visit you! I was wondering about your country's geography. Are there many mountains or is it mostly flat? Does it have a long coastline? What is the climate like in [Month of Visit]?

Feedback 
Starting with excitement is good. Asking about mountains/flatness and coastline are specific geographical questions. 'What is the climate like in [Month of Visit]?' is a practical question related to geography and weather. Good questions to learn about the country's physical features.
