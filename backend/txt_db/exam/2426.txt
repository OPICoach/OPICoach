Question 
I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. You want to buy a new piece of furniture for your home. At the store, you see a piece that you like. But you have some questions about it. Pretend you are speaking to a salesperson and ask three or four questions to get all the information you need about the furniture you like.

Answer 
Excuse me, I'm interested in this [Type of Furniture]. What material is it made of? What are the exact dimensions? Is assembly required?

Feedback

'What are the exact dimensions?' is crucial for fitting it in your home. 'Is assembly required?' is a practical question about setup. Good questions for buying furniture.
