Question 
I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. Your friend wants to go to the park this weekend. Call your friend and ask three or four questions about going to the park.

Answer 
Hey, you want to go to the park this weekend? Which park should we go to? What time should we meet? Should we bring anything, like snacks?

Feedback

'Should we bring anything, like snacks?' is a practical question about preparation. Natural questions for planning with a friend.
