Question 
I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. You want to buy an MP3 player. You have a friend who knows a lot about MP3 players. Call your friend and ask three or four questions to get information about buying an MP3 player.

Answer 
Hi [Friend's Name], I'm thinking of buying an MP3 player and you know a lot about them. What features should I look for? What brand do you recommend? Where is the best place to buy one?

Feedback 
'Hi [Friend's Name]...' and stating the reason ('thinking of buying an MP3 player', 'you know a lot') is good. 'What features should I look for?' asks for advice on specs. 'What brand do you recommend?' asks for a specific suggestion. 'Where is the best place to buy one?' is a practical question about purchasing. Good questions for getting advice from a knowledgeable friend.
