Question 
I would like to give you a situation that I need you to act it out. You're going to invite your best friend to a concert. Call your friend and ask three or four questions to invite him or her.

Answer 
Hey [Friend's Name], guess what? [Artist Name] is having a concert! Do you want to go with me? Are you free on [Date]? How much do you think tickets will cost?

Feedback 
'Hey [Friend's Name], guess what? [Artist Name] is having a concert!' builds excitement. 'Do you want to go with me?' is the direct invitation. 'Are you free on [Date]?' checks availability. 'How much do you think tickets will cost?' is a practical question about the potential expense. Natural questions for inviting a friend.
