Question 
I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. You want to watch a performance with your friends. Call the ticket office and ask three or four questions in order to buy tickets.

Answer 
Hello, I want to buy tickets for the [Performance Name] performance on [Date]. How many tickets can I buy at once? Are there different price ranges for seats? What payment methods do you accept?

Feedback 
'I want to buy tickets...' is clear. Specifying the performance and date is good. 'How many tickets can I buy at once?' is relevant if buying for multiple friends. 'Are there different price ranges for seats?' asks about options. 'What payment methods do you accept?' is a practical question. Good questions for buying performance tickets.
