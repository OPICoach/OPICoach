Question 
I'd like to give you a situation I need you to act out. Let's assume that you want to go for a walk with your friend. Call your friend and ask three or four questions about walking together.

Answer 
Hey [Friend's Name], do you want to go for a walk sometime? Where should we walk? What time works best for you? Should we walk in the morning or evening?

Feedback 
'Hey [Friend's Name], do you want to go for a walk sometime?' proposes the activity. 'Where should we walk?' asks about the route/location. 'What time works best for you?' asks about their availability. 'Should we walk in the morning or evening?' asks about the time of day. Good questions for planning a walk with a friend.
