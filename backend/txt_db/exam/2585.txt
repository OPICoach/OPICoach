Question 
You indicated in the survey that you go on a trip in your country. I would like you to describe one of the towns or cities you have visited.

Answer 
I love traveling to Gangwon Province. The place is well known for being undeveloped and having a clean natural environment. The main reason I enjoy going there is that it is such a beautiful place. Another good thing is that there are many things to do and many things to see. I can't wait to have back there. I still have vivid picture of it. I wish I could return to that moment.

Feedback 
This response for domestic travel to Gangwon Province demonstrates AL-level language. Using adjectives like 'undeveloped' and describing a 'clean natural environment' shows advanced vocabulary. The complex sentence structure 'The main reason I enjoy going there is that...' combining three clauses is excellent for AL. Phrases like 'Another good thing is that...' and 'many things to do and many things to see' are useful. The concluding expressions 'I can't wait to have back there', 'I still have a vivid picture of it' (using 'vivid'), and 'I wish I could return to that moment' are strong ways to convey positive feelings, avoiding simple phrases like 'it was good'. This structure can be adapted for other similar travel destinations.
