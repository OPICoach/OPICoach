Question 
You indicated in the survey that you go on a trip internationally. I would like you to describe one of the countries or cities you have visited.

Answer 
I love traveling to Cebu, which is definitely one of the dream destinations in the world. Nothing can beat it. We all agree that. The island is well known for being undeveloped and having a clean natural environment. Just letting you know. The main reason I enjoy going there is that it is such a beautiful island. It is really breathtaking. Another good thing is that there are so many things to do and so many things to see, whatever you go. I can't wait to have back there. I still have a vivid picture of it. I wish I could return to that moment.

Feedback 
This response for international travel to Cebu applies a similar structure to the domestic travel answer. It starts with a strong opening 'definitely one of the dream destinations in the world. Nothing can beat it. We all agree that.' It uses the 'well known for being undeveloped and having a clean natural environment' phrase (though Cebu is an island, not a province like Gangwon). The core structure 'The main reason is that...' and 'Another good thing is that...' is maintained. 'It is really breathtaking' is another strong descriptive phrase. The concluding phrases 'I can't wait to have back there', 'I still have a vivid picture of it', and 'I wish I could return to that moment' are effectively reused. This shows how a core structure can be adapted for different places.
