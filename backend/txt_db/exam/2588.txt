Question 
I would like to know where you live. Describe your house in detail.

Answer 
As for my house, I live in a high rise apartment with a balcony overlooking the Han River, which is a major river in Seoul, South Korea. It's really spacious and cozy. It has three bedrooms and two bathrooms. There is also a utility room where you can wash, dry your laundry and store things. There are some useful home appliances that you can think of here and there like everywhere. That is pretty much about the apartment that I live in. I love where I live. I'm pretty much satisfied with where I live.

Recommended vocabulary and phrases for high scores (IH/AL) are used effectively. 'high rise apartment' is better than just 'apartment' for higher scores. Connecting it with 'with a balcony' and 'overlooking...' or 'with a great view of...' adds detail and fluency. Describing the view ('the Han River, which is a major river...') is a good strategy. 'spacious and cozy' is a strong combination. Using 'utility room' (공개 단어) and explaining its function with 'where you can...' is excellent; 'where' functions like '거기서'. 'home appliances' (공개 단어) combined with 'that you can think of' (meaning 'typical' or 'standard') is a good phrase. 'here and there like everywhere' is a good way to say 'everywhere'. The concluding remarks like 'That is pretty much about...', 'I love where I live', and 'I'm pretty much satisfied with where I live' are good wrap-ups.
