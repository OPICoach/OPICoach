Question 
You indicated that you are responsible for doing household chores. Tell me about the household chores that you normally do.

Answer 
Speaking of house chores, what I do is mostly do the laundry, do the dishes, and take out the garbage. Since I don't have a lot of time during the weekdays, I do them usually on the weekends. I'm pretty much tied up with the house chores especially on the weekends. I'm telling you there's no end to the house chores. I mean it. If you know what I mean.

Feedback 
Excellent use of recommended phrases for high scores (IH/AL). Starting with 'Speaking of house chores' is a great transition. Using the structure 'what I do mostly is...' is highly recommended over simple 'I do...' for listing activities. Specific chores like 'do the laundry', 'do the dishes', and 'take out the garbage' are used (공개 단어). Explaining the timing with 'Since I don't have a lot of time during the weekdays, I do them usually on the weekends' adds detail. 'tied up with the house chores' is a strong phrase meaning 'busy with' or 'tied down by', better than just 'busy'. 'pretty much' adds nuance. 'There's no end to the house chores' is an excellent phrase to express endlessness. Adding fillers like 'I'm telling you', 'I mean it', and 'If you know what I mean' makes the speech sound more natural and advanced.
