Question 
Tell me about a memorable event or thing you experienced at restaurant.

Answer 
On my boyfriend's birthday, I had a meal with his parents. While dining, I was very nervous because it was the first time to meet them and have dinner together. I'm try to be very careful, but I accidentally dropped my spoon and even swallowed the wrong way. So I was choked and keep coughing several times. I was so embarrassed, but his parents understood me and made me feel comfortable. It was not that pleasant, but memorable.

Feedback 
On my boyfriend's birthday, I had a meal with his parents: Very good flow/chunking. 'I had a meal with his parents' sounds like one word (연음 - linking sounds). Chunking is necessary for IH. While dining, I was very nervous: Very good. 'While + ing' is useful ('while shopping', 'while jogging', etc.). Good for connecting sentences (분사 구문 - participial phrase). because it was the first time to meet them and have dinner together: Good background explanation. I'm try to be very careful: Grammatically incorrect ('I'm try' should be 'I try'). But delivered confidently, so it doesn't sound like a mistake. IH level can make mistakes if delivered confidently and fluently. but I accidentally dropped my spoon and even swallowed the wrong way: Very good flow/chunking. 'swallowed the wrong way' is understandable but not the standard way to say 'choked'. Standard is 'something I swallowed went down the wrong way/pipe/tube'. So I was choked and keep coughing several times: 'choked' (척트) sounds like 'chuck' (분필). 'Be choked' means angry. Should be 'choke on something' (I choked on water). 'keep coughing' should be 'kept coughing' (past tense). Mistakes are made but delivered confidently. I was so embarrassed: Very good. but his parents understood me and made me feel comfortable: Large, good chunk. 'comfortable' - suggests not breaking it up, reducing the 'f' sound or omitting it ('comfortable', 'comfortable'). It was not that pleasant, but memorable: Very good. Overall: Makes mistakes (grammar, word choice, tense) but passes over them confidently. Chunking is better (longer phrases delivered smoothly). Different feeling - confident, flowing. This flow and confidence, even with mistakes, leads to IH. Does not self-correct.
