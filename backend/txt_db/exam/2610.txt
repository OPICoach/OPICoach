Question 
What do people in your country do in their free time? How do they spend time with their family or friends? What is special about those activities?

Answer 
Korean people like to hike in the mountains. It's very popular because there are many mountains. Also, they like to eat out together, especially BBQ or Korean food. Young people like to go to cafes or watch movies. Spending time with family often involves eating meals together or traveling. With friends, they might go drinking or singing karaoke. What's special is that eating together is very important for bonding.

Feedback 
You've covered several common activities and distinguished between family and friends. Highlighting the importance of eating together is a good observation about the culture. To enhance this, you could use more varied vocabulary for activities (e.g., 'trekking,' 'socializing,' 'gathering') and describe *why* these activities are special or popular in more depth, perhaps mentioning the social aspect or the feeling they evoke.
