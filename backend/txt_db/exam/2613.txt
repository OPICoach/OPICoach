Question 
Have you ever had any problems with your home? What was your problem and how did you deal with it? How did the problem turn out? Give me as many details as possible.

Answer 
Yes, about a year ago, we had a problem with a water leak. It was coming from the ceiling in the bathroom. Water was dripping down, and the paint started to peel. It was quite worrying. We called the building management, and they sent a plumber. The plumber checked the pipes upstairs and found the source of the leak. It was a small crack in a pipe. He fixed it quickly. The building management also helped repaint the ceiling in our bathroom. So, the problem was fixed completely, and everything is fine now. It was stressful at the time, but it was resolved well.

Feedback 
You described a specific problem (water leak), its symptoms (dripping, peeling paint), how you dealt with it (called management, plumber), and the resolution (pipe fixed, ceiling repainted). You included details about the process and the outcome. Using words like 'worrying' and 'stressful' adds emotional detail. This is a strong answer. You could perhaps add a detail about the inconvenience it caused, like not being able to use the bathroom properly for a day.
