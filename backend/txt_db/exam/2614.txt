Question 
Tell me about one of your friends. Describe his or her personality and appearance in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
Okay, I'll tell you about my friend, Minjun. He is about my age, maybe a little taller, around 180 cm. He has short black hair and wears glasses sometimes. He's not very muscular, but he's active. Personality-wise, Minjun is very kind and funny. He always makes people laugh. He's also very reliable; if I need help, he's always there for me. He's quite optimistic and positive, which is why I enjoy spending time with him. He can be a bit shy at first, but once you get to know him, he's very outgoing.

Feedback 
You provided a good mix of physical description (height, hair, glasses) and personality traits (kind, funny, reliable, optimistic, shy/outgoing). You also explained *why* you appreciate his personality ('makes people laugh,' 'always there for me,' 'enjoy spending time with him'). This is a well-detailed description. To add more, you could mention a specific example that illustrates one of his personality traits.
