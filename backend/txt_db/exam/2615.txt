Question 
What are the activities you usually do with your friends on the weekends? Tell me everything in detail.

Answer 
On weekends, my friends and I usually hang out. We often meet for lunch or dinner at a restaurant. After eating, we might go to a cafe to talk for hours. Sometimes, we go shopping together, or if the weather is nice, we might go for a walk in a park or along the river. In the evening, we sometimes go to a bar or sing karaoke. We also like to visit exhibitions or watch movies together. It really depends on our mood and what's happening in the city, but eating and talking at cafes are our most common activities.

Feedback 
You listed a variety of common weekend activities with friends, covering food, relaxation, shopping, outdoor activities, and entertainment. You explained the typical flow (eat, then cafe). Using phrases like 'hang out' and 'depends on our mood' sounds natural. To add more detail, you could describe *why* you enjoy these activities or mention a specific memorable weekend activity.
