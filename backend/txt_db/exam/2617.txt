Question 
There's a situation I'd like you to act out. Let's suppose that you are planning a vacation with a friend. Call the travel agency and ask three or four questions to make a reservation for a hotel room.

Answer 
Okay, I understand. (Roleplay) Hello, I'd like to inquire about booking a hotel room for a trip next month. My friend and I are planning to visit [City/Area] from [Start Date] to [End Date]. We need a room for two people. Could you tell me about the available hotels in that area for those dates? Specifically, I'd like to know about the price range, if breakfast is included, and if they have twin beds instead of a double bed. Also, could you tell me about the cancellation policy? Thank you.

Feedback 
Excellent roleplay! You clearly stated the purpose of the call, provided necessary details (destination, dates, number of people), and asked four relevant and practical questions about availability, price, inclusions (breakfast, bed type), and policy (cancellation). Your tone was polite and appropriate for the situation. This demonstrates strong functional language skills.
