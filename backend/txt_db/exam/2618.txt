Question 
That's the end of the situation. Have you experienced a problem while traveling? What was the problem and how did you deal with it? Describe it in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
Yes, I have. A few years ago, I was traveling in Europe, and my luggage got lost. I flew from Paris to Rome, and when I arrived in Rome, my suitcase wasn't on the baggage carousel. I waited for a long time, but it never appeared. I went to the lost and found office at the airport and filed a report. I had to give them a description of my suitcase and my contact information. It was very inconvenient because all my clothes and toiletries were in the suitcase. I had to buy some basic things in Rome. Luckily, the airline found my suitcase two days later and delivered it to my hotel. It was a stressful experience, but it was resolved in the end.

Feedback 
You described a common travel problem (lost luggage) in detail, including where and when it happened, the impact (inconvenience, buying new items), how you dealt with it (filed a report), and the resolution (suitcase found and delivered). You used appropriate vocabulary like 'baggage carousel,' 'lost and found office,' and 'filed a report.' This is a comprehensive and well-structured answer.
