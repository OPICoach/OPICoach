Question 
I play the violin in an orchestra. Ask me three or four questions about this activity.

Answer 
Okay, that sounds interesting! Let me ask you some questions. First, how long have you been playing the violin and participating in an orchestra? Second, what kind of music does your orchestra usually play? Do you perform concerts often? And finally, what do you enjoy most about playing in an orchestra?

Feedback 
You asked four clear and relevant questions about the user's activity. The questions cover the duration of the activity, the type of music/performances, and the personal enjoyment aspect. These are good open-ended questions that would allow the interviewer to elaborate. This demonstrates good question-forming ability.
