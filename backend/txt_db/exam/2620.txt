Feedback 
The instructor explains how different parts of the OPIc test contribute to the final score. Key points include:
1.  **Question Types and Placement:** The test has 15 questions. Questions 11, 12, 13 are typically Role-Play. Questions 14, 15 are final questions. 돌발 (unexpected) topics can appear in the first half (Q2-10) and the second half (Q11-15).
2.  **Importance of Asking Questions (질문하기):** The ability to ask questions is critical for distinguishing lower scores (NH, IL, IM1, IM2, IM3). NH cannot ask questions, IL can ask simple ones. IM3 requires more sophisticated question-asking. Questions 11 (part of Role-Play) and 15 (depending on difficulty level 3/4+) specifically test this skill. Not scoring well on asking questions prevents reaching IM3.
3.  **Importance of Past Tense (과거 시제):** Question 13 specifically measures the use of past tense. This is important for distinguishing scores at the IH level and above.
4.  **Importance of Problem-Solving/Solutions (해결책):** The Role-Play section (especially Q12, 13) often requires problem-solving or offering solutions (임기응변). This skill is crucial for achieving IH and higher scores.
5.  **Role-Play (Q11-13):** This section is highly important as it helps differentiate candidates across all levels, from low to high, by testing asking questions, past tense, and problem-solving.
