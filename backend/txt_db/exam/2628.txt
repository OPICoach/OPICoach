Question 
I would like to know where you live. Can you describe your home to me? What does it look like? How many rooms does it have? Give me a description with lots of details.

Answer 
Um, all right. Uh, I live in a tiny little studio, uh, which is located in Seoul. And I recently moved there. And I love my home because it is really comfy. But you know, one thing I do not like about my studio is that um, it's right next to the train station. So always I can hear some train sound and it is really noisy. But except that, I love my house. I mean, I love my studio.

Feedback 
The beginning ('Um, all right. Uh,') is natural and good. 'Tiny little studio' is a good combination of adjectives. If you don't know a word, describe it using words you know. When mentioning Seoul, it's good practice to add context like 'the capital city of South Korea'. Using fillers like 'Anyway' helps maintain flow. You need to use more filler combinations like 'and um'. The main point ('really comfy') needs more elaboration; explain *why* it's comfy and how you feel about it. You used the positive-negative strategy (99% positive, 1% negative), which is good, but you need more positive details before introducing the negative point. The conclusion was too abrupt after the negative point.
