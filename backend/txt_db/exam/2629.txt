Question 
What is your normal routine at home? What things do you usually do on weekdays and what kinds of things do you do on weekends?

Answer 
Um, you know, um, I'm looking for a job nowadays. And on weekday, uh, I go to library. So I use my studio as a sleeping place. Um, so I do not st- uh, do not do some things on my house. And weekend, um, on a weekend, I always watch Netflix. And it is really good because it relieves your stress and you don't have to think about anything. And yeah. I think that's pretty much I do on the weekend.

Feedback 
For clarity (especially for AL), state your main point first. Instead of starting with the reason ('I'm looking for a job nowadays'), start with the result ('I'm rarely home'). Correct 'on weekday' to 'on weekdays' and 'on my house' to 'in my house' or use 'I'm rarely home'. You need to use more filler combinations like 'and um'. If you want to focus on one part (e.g., weekends), use a contrasting word like 'but' to transition from the less important part (weekdays). Your answer was 50-50 between weekdays and weekends; for a clear AL, focus on one main point (e.g., weekends) and elaborate more on it, including how you feel and why it's important. OPIc values clear communication over perfect grammar.
