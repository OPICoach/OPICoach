Question 
What do you usually do whenever you go overseas?

Answer 
All right. Um you know, whenever I go to another country or overseas cities, I always find good restaurant, you know, where serve very good food. You know, um yeah. Because I'm a super foodie. So whenever I have very delicious food, I feel happy. But whenever, you know, when I was young, so I didn't care about eat it, but, you know, I'm these days, I really I really um happy feel feel happy when I have food, delicious food. So that's why I I really want delicious food.

Feedback 
Consider adding 'try to' or similar after "I always find". Continue to focus on explaining 'why' food makes you happy. Good use of fillers like "um", "you know", "yeah", but avoid the long "mm" sound.
