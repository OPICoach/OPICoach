Question 
Severe weather conditions can do a lot of damage. Tell me about an experience you had related to severe weather conditions. Perhaps a city was flooded or maybe businesses or schools closed due to heavy snow. What was the problem? How did you deal with that situation?

Answer 
Oh, weather conditions. Uh, okay. But, um, since I've never ever experienced any kind of serious weather related problems, like disasters or something, um, I think I would just have to say about my experience in Australia. Because, uh, you know what? Uh, the weather condition of Melbourne, uh, was really crazy. I mean, um, even though I was there in summer, um, I was able to experience uh, several seasons only in one day. Uh, uh, what am I trying to say is, um, you know, the weather condition of Melbourne, uh, is really broken and fluctuating. So, uh, while I was traveling there, um, I had to bring a like jacket or a sweater just in case the weather changes suddenly.

Feedback 
Overall, this answer is assessed as IH, with potential for AL if lucky, primarily due to a clear message and constant speaking using fillers. To achieve AL consistently, focus on a clearer main point earlier and potentially use direct quotations.

- "Oh, weather conditions. Uh, okay.": Good use of "oh" to show thinking. "Okay" is a bit awkward; "alright" would be better.
- "But, um, since I've never ever experienced any kind of serious weather related problems, like disasters or something...": Honesty is good, but starting with this delays the main point. It's better to place this later, perhaps in the conclusion. Adding "natural" before "disasters" would be more precise.
- "Um, I think I would just have to say about my experience in Australia.": "I would just have to say" is a good AL expression, but the following phrase is too general. It should be more specific, e.g., "that Australia has crazy weather."
- "Because, uh, you know what? Uh, the weather condition of Melbourne, uh, was really crazy.": This is the main point. "You know what?" is an excellent AL expression. For AL, the main point should be clearer about whether it was good or bad and stated within 20 seconds (IH within 30 seconds). "Weather condition of Melbourne" is awkward; "weather in Melbourne" is more natural.
- Fillers (e.g., "um," "uh," "you know"): Used effectively to maintain constant speaking, which is crucial for IH.
- "I mean, um, even though I was there in summer, um, I was able to experience uh, several seasons only in one day.": "in summer" is acceptable, but "during the summer" is more natural. "only in one day" is okay, but "in a single day" adds a bit more detail for AL.
- "Uh, uh, what am I trying to say is, um, you know, the weather condition of Melbourne, uh, is really broken and fluctuating.": "What am I trying to say?" is an excellent AL phrase for restarting or rephrasing. However, it should be followed by a pause or a word like "anyway," not "is," to signal a restart. The double "uh, uh" is unnatural and better suited for role-play questions (like Q11). "Weather condition" is awkward; "weather in Melbourne" is better. "Broken" is awkward for weather; "fluctuating" is good. An AL version could be: "The weather in Melbourne was fluctuating constantly."
- "So, uh, while I was traveling there, um, I had to bring a like jacket or a sweater just in case the weather changes suddenly.": This is the concluding sentence. Grammatical error: "changes" should be "changed" (past tense). "A like jacket" should be "a light jacket." "Just in case" is a good, natural expression. An AL+ conclusion could be: "And so while I was traveling there, I hated how unpredictable the weather was. But luckily, I had my light jacket to save the day."
- To guarantee AL: Ensure a clear, specific main point within 20 seconds. Consider using direct quotations to demonstrate skill in mixing tenses and make the narrative more vivid.
