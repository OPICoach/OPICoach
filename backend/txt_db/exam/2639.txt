Question 
Tell me about a TV show you recently watched or a popular TV show in your country.

Answer 
Squid Game went viral not only in Korea but also around the world. And it is now the most popular series in Netflix's history. So, I have been binge watching Squid Game and I got to say that I expected it to be good but I didn't expect it to be great because of the twist in the final episode. I enjoyed it overall. This show seems to have the vibe of parasite and that's a great compliment. It talks about the class system that is based on capitalism and the problems with the poor and the rich. Squid Game is basically Hunger Games combined with traditional Korean children's games. It's Netflix's biggest ever series that criticizes how society is. And the participants have to play children's games. And if they lose, they are basically killed for that. To start with the things that I liked, the first thing that I liked was the characters. Not all the characters were likable, but the writing for the characters were really well made to the point where even if they appeared in one episode, they were still memorable. I can literally show any pictures of the main characters and every person who has seen the show would remember a specific moment that made the character more special. What I'm trying to say is that the characters were really memorable for me and that's definitely because of the good writing. My favorite characters are the main characters played by 이정재 and 정호연. Second of all, what I liked about this show was the games in the show. The costumes and the cinematography of the series caught my eye. It seems to be cinematic. But the games are extremely entertaining that kept me on the edge of my seat and I couldn't take my eyes off. I was kind of bored in the first episode, but the minute the first game started, I got immediately hooked on it. I'm not going to spoil the rest of the games, but just to let you know, every game was pretty entertaining. Overall, I really enjoyed this series and I would highly recommend it.
