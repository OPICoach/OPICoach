Question 
Tell me about a memorable incident that happened at a coffee shop. What happened? Who was involved? How did you deal with the situation? Tell me everything about what happened from beginning to end.

Answer 
I have the perfect story to tell you. 음, I once borrowed my boyfriend's laptop, and I was waiting for him at 투썸플레이스. You know, all of a sudden I felt like going to the washroom. So, I left leaving the laptop on the table. And then my boyfriend came to the coffee shop, and he was shocked to see the laptop alone. And what you have to realize is that he was being very paranoid about his laptop. And, you know, when I came back, he was like, 'Hey, are you crazy? What are you thinking?' And this made my blood boil to the max. As I couldn't believe how obnoxious he was being. And, uh, what am I trying to say? Uh, we ended up fighting, and eventually he apologized for being stupid. And so we were able to make up in the end.

Feedback 
The start "I have the perfect story to tell you" sounds too scripted; it's better to show thinking first (e.g., "음, all right. I think I have the perfect story." or "오케이, you know what? I have the perfect story."). The initial filler "음," is awkward; "음," is better. The main point "I once borrowed my boyfriend's laptop, and I was waiting for him at 투썸플레이스" lacks the climax. It's better to include the main event (the fight) in the main point (e.g., "I once borrowed my boyfriend's laptop, and I pretty much got into a big fight with him because of that at 투썸."). This makes the story clearer and easier for the grader to follow and helps structure the rest of the answer. The "You know" filler in "You know, all of a sudden..." is too slow and sounds scripted; it should be faster ("You know, all of a sudden"). The detail "leaving the laptop on the table" is excellent and natural, showing how to extend a simple sentence effectively. Practice extending sentences with more detail. The feeling conveyed by "shocked" is very good and natural. Encourage using "shocked". Can be extended further (e.g., "you know, he couldn't believe that I left..."). "What you have to realize is that" is an excellent starting phrase to draw attention ("listen carefully"). "paranoid" is a good, difficult word used naturally. If using new words, it's helpful to explain them in the next sentence if unsure (e.g., "He was being very paranoid. You know, he was just being so crazy about his laptop."). "And, you know" is a smooth filler. Suggests mixing fillers (e.g., "And you know, so you know, and um you know"). "he was like" is a very natural alternative to "He said," commonly used by native speakers and highly recommended for sounding natural. Using direct quotation (present tense inside) skillfully shows the ability to mix tenses within a past experience narrative. For "'Hey, are you crazy? What are you thinking?'", "What were you thinking?" might sound slightly smoother ("what were you thinking at that time?"). "this made my blood boil" is an excellent idiom for expressing anger. "to the max" adds emphasis. Suggests saying it slower ("to the max") to convey the feeling better. "I couldn't believe how obnoxious he was being" is an excellent sentence structure and word ("obnoxious" is similar to "very annoying"). The phrase "I couldn't believe how..." is very useful and should be practiced (e.g., "I couldn't believe how beautiful...", "I couldn't believe how stuffed..."). "And, uh, what am I trying to say?" is a very smooth thinking phrase/filler that will impress graders. Suggests alternatives ("What am I saying?", "How can I explain this?", "How should I explain this?"). Points out a slight pause ("What am I trying to say?") and suggests saying it faster and connected ("what am I trying to say?"). "We ended up fighting" is a good phrase ("결국에는 이렇게 됐다"). Using "stupid" in "for being stupid" sounds very natural, like a native speaker. Using "we were able to" before the main verb ("make up") in "we were able to make up in the end" is an AR-level structure, showing skill in using past tense structures compared to a simpler "we made up". Recommend practicing "be able to" structures.
