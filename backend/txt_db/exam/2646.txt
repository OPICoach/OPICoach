Thank you foreigners. You know what I'm saying? The thing about, you know, age in Korea is that it's so confusing. Sometimes you're a year older, sometimes two years older. 너무 헷갈려. Okay, there's some coffee lovers here, right? Okay, no, they're running away. Koreans run away. That's for sure. Koreans definitely run away. But I'm gonna find a coffee lover for sure. Okay, 여기 여기. They run away, you see? They run away. They run away. Okay. It's okay. It's surprising how there's no foreigners here in Gangnam, man. I don't know why. Every time I come to Gangnam, I see so many foreigners but um it's like today, they don't want to go out or something, you know? It's kind of strange. So far, it's 99.9% Koreans. Which is understandable. I mean, it is Korea after all. Hey guys, all you have to do is guess my age and I will give you a Starbucks gift card. It is that simple. Okay. Alright. And tell me the year because in Korea, we use different, you know, the age system. Do we get two chances or one? Two chances. You know what? I'll give you three chances just because you guys are looking so nice. Okay. Can I put you on YouTube in case you get it right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Perfect. Here we go. Guess my age. Come on. Here, we have to guess the year, right? You have to guess the year, yes. And I'm gonna give you a clue, right? Three chances and if you get it wrong, I'll say higher or lower. That simple. Okay, okay. 1990. 1990? Wonderful guess. Older. Older. Older. Older. Older. I could be a grandfather, man. Come on. Go way higher. You want to go back and forth like this or what? 19 87. 87?

Okay, thank you so much guys. Alright, take care. Alright. Let's go to a different area now. Just to change it up. I initially wanted to do this outside but then it's actually so cold. We're hovering inside the Gangnam, what do you call this? The underground city. Alright, there's a bunch of stores here. I think it's really cool. Hey guys, I would like to give you guys free Starbucks. Um, cuz it's so cold. All you have to do is guess my age. That's all. It's for YouTube. If you don't want to be part of it, I understand. But why not? $10. $10. Guess my age right here. Come on. My old age. Please guess my old age. 30. 30, 30, 32. 32? That's a good guess. I'll I'll give you a chance. It is incorrect. It's a very good guess though. 30. 30? Oh, it's good guess. Alright, I promise you I'm 33. Are you? I promise you. But good try. Alright, thanks guys. Hi, excuse me, excuse me. I would love to give you a Starbucks gift card. I'll give you three chances. Get my age. That's all. That's all. Three chances. Can I put you on YouTube though? Yes, you can. Oh, awesome. Okay. Alright, guess my age and then I'll give you I'll give you a clue. If you get it wrong, I'll go higher or lower. That's all. Okay. Go ahead. Your age. Uh, 30. 30? That's a good guess. Higher than that. Much higher. Come on. Higher. 40. 40? Okay, that's true. That's true. Okay, lower. Lower. One more chance. One more chance. It's $100. I'm just kidding. $10. 34. 34? Oh, 33. I'm 33. Okay, 33. Alright, thank you so much. What's what's the name of the video? Open no jam. Open no. Can you remember that? I'm like way higher. 40. Crap, man. That was an arrow in my heart. If you guess my age, I'm gonna give you a Starbucks gift card. It is that simple. Can I put you on YouTube though? Three guesses. Alright, perfect. 28. 28? That's a good guess. Higher than that. Two more guesses. Here we go. 32. 32? So close. But maybe not. One more. Higher. Really? Higher, yeah. We'll go 35. 35? I am 33. Thanks so much. I feel kind of bad and I I wanted to just give it to them anyway but I'm cheap. Very cheap. It's so hard to talk to the Koreans because like they give you such a cold face and I'm just like, whoa. But then, you know, it's probably understandable. There's a lot of scammers here maybe. I want to give you a Starbucks gift card. Just guess my age. That's all. Three guesses. Come on. 34.

Yeah, you have to get it right. You have to get it exact. Three chances. Three chances. She could. She could. She could. She could. But she's too shy. If it were me, I would totally say yes to every single one of these kind of things. But you know, I I don't blame the Koreans for not wanting to talk to me because when I first came to Korea, you know those like um those poke people, the door people, they would come up to me like crazy and I would always talk to them and then I realized, I don't want to talk to them anymore, you know? I feel like I'm getting scammed or something. So, I totally get it. Okay. We'll we'll stand right here. If you guess my age, I'm gonna give you guys a Starbucks gift card. All three of you. $10 each. I'll give you three chances. 36. 36? That's a good guess. Lower. Come on, look at me. 한국 나이 말 나이. 한국 한국 나이. 나이. 오, 한국말 잘하시네요. 와우. 잘 못해요. 너무 잘해요. 와우, so impressive.
