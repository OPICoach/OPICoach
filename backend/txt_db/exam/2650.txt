Question 
What are some of the companies that young people want to work for these days?

Answer 
Wow. That's a really tough question. I've never really thought about it. Let me give it a shot. Oh you know hackers right? Well they make famous smartphones and their electronics industry seems really promising. I think lots of young people want to work for that company for several reasons. Well first off, they pay a lot. As far as I know, new employees make like at least um $5,000 a month, which is incredibly high compared to other companies payments right? What's more. Oh yeah. not to mention their welfare. You know what? one of my friends working for hackers works just 20 hours a week. You know I'm so jealous of her. Yeah I think that's why everyone's eager to work for hackers nowadays.

Feedback 
The feedback covers 8 reasons why test-takers might stay at IM2 and solutions to reach IH. Reasons include: speaking too short or repetitively, speaking word by word, frequent grammar errors (especially tense and 3rd person singular), poor pronunciation/intonation/stress, lack of confidence/mumbling, monotone speaking, presentation-like style (listing facts), and speaking too fast or without variation (rapper style). Solutions involve: using diverse patterns, linking ideas naturally with fillers/conjunctions, speaking in meaningful chunks, using fillers to think ahead, being conscious of grammar (especially tense agreement and basic structures), practicing pronunciation/intonation through shadowing and recording comparison, learning word sounds correctly (e.g., hotel, elevator, gadget, walk, salmon, relatives, freaked out, panicked), speaking loudly and projecting, using tongue twisters for practice, varying speed and intonation to sound natural and expressive (acting out emotions), adding feelings/thoughts after stating facts, and starting answers slowly before gradually increasing speed. Key phrases introduced include: give it a shot, promising (for industry), as far as I know, compared to, not to mention, jealous, eager to, nowadays. For difficult questions, the advice is to keep answers short (around 1 minute), focus on main points, use fillers/state the difficulty, use examples (even fabricated), mention specific numbers, and use the MBC (Main idea, Body, Conclusion) structure.
