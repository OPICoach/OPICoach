Question 
Tell me about the weather at where you live. How are the seasons? What is the weather like in each season? Which season do you personally like?

Answer 
Um, all right, of course, as you can, um, you know, as you know, there are four seasons in Korea and each of them has very distinctive characteristics. Um, but especially I like winter just because it's simply because I hate summer.

Feedback 
AL requires significant control. This answer effectively uses multiple control words/phrases: 'of course' (smooth), 'as you know' (though 'as you may already know' is suggested), 'especially' (shows focus from general to specific), and 'just because' / 'it's simply because' (smoothly explains reasons, like the Korean 'ë”±'). These show articulation and understanding.
