Question 
Tell me about the weather at where you live. How are the seasons? What is the weather like in each season? Which season do you personally like?

Answer 
Uh, all right, um, here in Korea, we have just four seasons and um, to be honest, I don't really know um, any other countries that doesn't have four seasons. Uh, anyway, um, because now, um, we are, we are in summer, so I want to tell you some, you know, summer, about summer.

Feedback 
AL requires significant control. This answer uses control words/phrases like 'to be honest' (good, similar to Korean '사실'; 'to tell you the truth' is an alternative, avoid 'frankly'), 'I don't really know' (simple but effective; 'I don't know why' is suggested), and 'anyway' (good for transitioning from general to a specific point/strategy). These demonstrate thought process and smooth flow.
