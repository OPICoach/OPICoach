Question 
How does internet usage vary among people of different age groups? How do they use the internet differently? Please discuss this matter in more detail.

Answer 
The text describes a strategy for answering unexpected questions like this by 'controlling' the question. Instead of answering the broad question directly, the student should pivot to a topic they have prepared perfectly (e.g., housing, coffee shops, music). The answer would start by linking the general topic (internet) to the prepared topic. Examples given are: 'I think people of different age groups stream music differently using the internet.' or 'You know, I think people of different age groups use the internet differently whenever they're at a coffee shop.' The rest of the answer would then focus on the prepared topic.

Feedback 
The text provides two main methods for handling unexpected questions: 1. Skipping the question directly. This is recommended for 99% of students, especially if unprepared, as it's safer than trying to make awkward excuses. 2. Controlling the question. This involves linking the unexpected question to a topic you have prepared perfectly. This method requires having at least 3 topics prepared perfectly. The text strongly advises against making excuses (like 'this question is too difficult') and then moving on, especially in English. This is considered 'risky' because it requires perfect vocabulary, grammar, and intonation to sound natural and not like a script. Awkward excuses can lead to a lower score than simply skipping. Students who cannot prepare at least 3 topics perfectly are advised not to take the test yet.
