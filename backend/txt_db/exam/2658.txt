Question 
Tell me about a time when you try to eat healthy. What kinds of foods did you eat and why did you think they were good for you?

Answer 
Last year I got a weight a lot. So I tried to just the special kind of diet like drinking just protein shake without any kind of meal for a day. And it was really terrible because I was always hungry. I mean I was craving all the time. Yeah, so Last year since I got a lot of weight, I searched about um some meal menu for a diet like eating just chicken breast for a day or having just a salad for a day.

Feedback 
Last year: Specific start. Better to start general like "a while back" or "around last year" and then get specific. I got a weight a lot: Awkward phrasing. Use "I gained a lot of weight" or "I gained so much weight". Don't use "my weight". So I tried to just the special kind of diet like drinking just protein shake without any kind of meal for a day: Too complicated. Simplify to "So I decided to drink/have a lot of protein shakes" or "So I drank a lot of protein shakes". Mention replacing meals. And it was really terrible because I was always hungry: Perfect sentence. I mean I was craving all the time: "Craving" is good. Specify what was craved, e.g., "craving food all the time". Yeah, so Last year since I got a lot of weight: 'Yeah, so' is good. 'Last year' again - try a transition like "Like I said" or vary the time phrase. "got a lot of weight" should be "gained a lot of weight". I searched about um some meal menu for a diet: Can add 'my' - "for my diet". like eating just chicken breast for a day: Good food example. Suggest "one meal a day" instead of "for a day". or having just a salad for a day: Good food example. Suggest "for a meal" or "one meal a day".
