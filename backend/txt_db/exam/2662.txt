Question 
Sometimes problems can arise when you are at the bank. Tell me in detail about a problem you had that involved your bank. Maybe the bank was closed or perhaps the bank might have made some kind of mistake. Tell me about how you solved the problem.

Answer 
Let's face it. I think everyone has like different experience on this matter. But like I would like to say um, you know, I I I saw like bank robbery on on the bank like when I withdraw my money and I was just panicked, totally panicked. Like actually like last year, I guess and you know, I I just just want to like my money and you know, I I just I was sitting sitting on the like, okay.

너무 너무 잘하시는 거 아닙니까? 너무 너무 잘하네요. 메인 포인트가 너무 깔끔했어요. 초반 이렇게 let's face it. 와 일단은 let's face it 되게 어려운 표현인데. let's face it으로 시작하는 게 와 사실 놀라웠습니다. 요즘에 많이 임프브가 되는 거 같아요. 뱅크 얘기하고 그다음에 그 링까지 얘기했다. 너무 깔끔했어요. 여기 얘기할 게 많이 없습니다. 뱅크는 일단은 너무 잘했어요. 메인 포인트 성공했으니까.
