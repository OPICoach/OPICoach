Feedback 
The student used many fillers, but they sounded natural and not like a script. The main point of the answer was weak. The answer could be improved by strengthening the main point, which should clearly explain the problem, how the student felt, and why they felt that way. The conclusion should then present the solution (buying the Samsung vacuum cleaner).
