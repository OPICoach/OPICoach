Question 
That's the end of the situation. Have you ever bought a piece of technology which was not what you wanted or different from what you had expected? Was the feature not what you wanted or did it just not work properly? Tell me about a time when you bought some new technology.

Answer 
Well, um, you know what? Um, I, I really like um, clean my room. So, I bought um, you know, uh, Dyson vacuum cleaner. You know, um, Dyson is, I think the, uh, one of the most, um, popular vacuum cleaners in the world. So, I bought it. And, uh, first time, I really like it because, um, I can, um, easily, uh, clean my room. But, you know, um, the Dyson vacuum cleaner, it was, um, too heavy. So, um, I couldn't use it. So, it was, um, too bad because, um, I'm very clean girl. I'm, but, um, with Dyson, uh, I couldn't, um, clean my room and, um, my bed or something like that. So, uh, after that, um, I bought, um, Samsung vacuum cleaner. You know, um, Samsung vacuum cleaner is much better. So, um, I recommend you, Ava, um, if you want to buy new vacuum cleaner, um, you can buy Samsung. Samsung is the best.

Feedback 
The student used simple vocabulary and made grammatical mistakes but received an AL grade. The message was clear and easy to understand. The student effectively used hyperbole ('one of the most popular... in the world', 'easily', 'too heavy', 'much better', 'the best') to show emotion and passion. The student also used fillers ('um', 'you know', 'well') naturally, which made the response sound less scripted and more like genuine thinking. While the main point could have been stronger, the overall clarity, use of strategies, and natural delivery contributed to the high score.
