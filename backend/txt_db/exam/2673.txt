Question 
Tell me about the weather at where you live. How are the seasons? What is the weather like in each season? Which season do you personally like?

Answer 
I love winter the most because I love the snow. I hate summer because it's too hot. I also hate spring and fall because it's too windy. But my favorite season is winter because I love making snowman. I realized that making snowman is really fun. That's why I love winter the most.

Feedback 
Apply the SMART strategy. S: State your main point simply (favorite season and reason). M: Mention other seasons briefly (can be negative points). Use 'also' for additional points. A: Return to your main point (favorite season) and add a little more detail or example. R: State something you realized or learned (can be simple, like 'it's fun'). Use the 'I realized that...' pattern. T: Conclude by restating your main point. Keep sentences short and simple for IL/IM1 level. Aim for around 6 sentences.
