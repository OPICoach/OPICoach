Question 
Severe weather conditions can do a lot of damage. Tell me about an experience you had related to severe weather conditions. Perhaps a city was flooded or maybe businesses or schools closed due to heavy snow. What was the problem? How did you deal with that situation? Give me all the details about that experience.

Answer 
I once was late for work. I couldn't take the bus because of the heavy snow. It was so terrible. I was waiting for the bus for over an hour but it didn't come. I realized that I should check the weather apps. I could never forget that day.

Feedback 
This is a Past Experience (Problem) question. S: State the problem simply (late for work due to snow). Use 'I once was...'. M: For beginner levels (IL/IM1), you can often skip M1 and M2 in problem questions as transitions can be difficult. A: Describe what happened next or the main event of the problem. Keep it simple. R: State what you realized or learned from the experience. Use 'I realized that...'. T: Conclude with a feeling or final thought about the experience. Keep the content simple and easy to express in English.
