This is a comparison question, which is often challenging but important for high scores. The answer starts with excessive fillers ("Um actually um online, you know?" taking almost six seconds), which should be reduced for higher levels (IH+). While fillers are better than silence, aim for shorter usage. "When I was a little" is a common mistake; it should be "when I was little" or "when I was just a kid/young". The phrase "I have to uh I have to to do bank just offline, you know?" is confusing. "Offline" used this way is Konglish; suggest alternatives like "go to the bank in person," "physically go to the bank," or "personally went to the bank." "But nowadays we can do work bank stuff online" is good, especially the use of "nowadays." Rephrasing "work bank stuff" to "bank work" or simply "do online banking" would be clearer. "And such as smartphone, you know?" needs adjustment; suggest "using our smartphones" or "with a smartphone." "I think, yeah, it's very convenience" shows skillful use of "yeah" but uses the wrong word; it should be "convenient." The repetition in "Yeah, super convenience" is good for emphasis but again uses "convenience" instead of "convenient." "We can do everything online and mobile about uh bank stuff, you know?" is okay, but the phrase "bank stuff" could be more specific like "online banking" or "mobile banking." The use of "you know" is excessive (almost every sentence) and should be reduced for higher scores, although it's a skillful filler when used sparingly. The comparison strategy (MP, Past, Present, Humorous/Unique Conclusion) can significantly improve the structure and delivery. Start with a Main Point (MP) about the present (e.g., banking is easy with smartphones), then describe the Past (e.g., going to the bank in person, why it was inconvenient), return to the Present (e.g., how technology makes it easy now), and finish with a humorous or unique Conclusion (e.g., smartphone as a second boyfriend, thanking the phone for enabling laziness).
