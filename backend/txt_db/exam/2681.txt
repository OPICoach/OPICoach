Question 
Banks have definitely changed over time. Tell me about a bank you remember from your childhood. What did the bank look like? How was it different from banks today?

Answer 
Um actually um all right, you know uh when okay, so when I was little, I have to uh I have to to do bank just offline, you know. But nowadays we can do work bank stuff online and such as smartphone, you know. I think yeah, it's very convenience, you know. Yeah, super convenient, you know what I mean? And then we can do everything online and mobile about bank stuff, you know.

Feedback 
The answer starts with excessive fillers ('Um actually um all right, you know uh when okay, so'). The phrase 'when I was a little' should be 'when I was little' or 'when I was a little kid'. 'I have to to do bank just offline' is grammatically awkward; 'offline' is not the correct term for in-person banking (suggested alternatives: 'in person', 'physically go to the bank'). 'we can do work bank stuff online' could be clearer, e.g., 'we can do bank work online' or 'online banking'. 'such as smartphone' needs clarification, e.g., 'using our smartphones' or 'with a smartphone'. 'it's very convenience' is incorrect; it should be 'it's very convenient'. The repetition of 'convenient' (though mispronounced initially) is good, but the pronunciation needs correction. The phrase 'bank stuff' is acceptable but could be more formal. The frequent use of 'you know' (almost every sentence) weakens the communication, especially for higher levels. The answer structure starts with the past ('when I was little') instead of following the recommended comparison strategy (Main Point/Present -> Past -> Present comparison -> Conclusion/Unique point).
