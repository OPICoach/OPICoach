Question 
When you're by yourself, what sort of things do you get up to? (or OPIc question like "What do you do at home?")

Answer 
It's it's actually very embarrassing. I don't do much when I'm on my own. Um I hang out with my dogs. That's doing something. Yeah, um I like to just stay home with my family, like eat something nice. Strawberries in season in Korea. So these days like that's my go-to every day. And just relax, just rest from everything.
