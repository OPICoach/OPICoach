Question 
Think about what you did during your free time as a child. Do you have more free time now than when you were a child? Tell me about your free time now compared to when you were a child.

Answer 
Um, all right. I think I didn't do anything much when I was child during my free time. And um, at the time, I really like to stayed at home and relax. And my mom was usually like, "Rachel, did you do your homework?" or "Rachel, clean your room." Whenever I had my free time, she always nagged at me to do something more productive. And um, I found it so annoying, and I never understood why she wouldn't let me be. But now, I have more freedom from my mom. And um, whenever I had my free time, I really like to go to the movies. And uh, luckily, there's movie theater nearby my home. And I think I am starting to get old now because I don't feel like going too far. You know what I mean? And um, I'm not sure if I have more free time now as an adult, but what is for certain is that I have definitely more freedom from my mom's nagging.

Feedback 
This is a comparison question. A key strategy for comparison questions is to have a clear main point, ideally a 'pure present' statement focusing only on the present without comparison words. However, this question is rare as it ends with the past, so comparing the present to the past is the format. Rachel uses an advanced strategy by starting with what was asked last (the past). Specific feedback:
- 'anything much': Very good expression, can be used widely.
- 'when I was child': Needs 'a', should be 'when I was a child'.
- 'during my free time': 'whenever I had free time' is more natural. Also, 'my' is redundant here; 'whenever I had free time' is better.
- 'at the time': 'during those times' or 'back then' are better alternatives.
- 'like to stayed': Should be 'liked to stay' (liked + infinitive) or 'liked staying' (liked + gerund).
- 'And my mom was usually like, "Rachel, did you do your homework?" or "Rachel, clean your room."': Skillful use of double direct quotation.
- 'She always nagged at me to do something more productive': Good use of 'nagged' and 'productive'.
- 'I found it so annoying': Good expression of feeling. 'I found it' (past) is better than 'I find it' (present) for a past experience.
- 'why she wouldn't let me be': Adding 'just' ('why she wouldn't just let me be') makes it more natural.
- 'But now, I have more freedom from my mom': Perfect sentence.
- 'whenever I had my free time' (in the present context): Should be 'whenever I have free time'. Again, remove 'my'.
- 'I really like to go to the movies': 'go to the movies' is very natural, better than 'go to the movie theater'.
- 'luckily, there's a movie theater nearby my home': Good detail with 'luckily'.
- 'I'm starting to get old now because I don't feel like going too far': Excellent, natural, native-like sentence structure ('I'm starting to', 'don't feel like'). 'I feel like' and 'I don't feel like' are great expressions to use.
- 'You know what I mean?': Good way to engage the listener.
- Conclusion ('I'm not sure if I have more free time now... but what is for certain is that I have definitely more freedom from my mom's nagging'): A powerful and 'smexy' conclusion that naturally ties back to a previous point (nagging). Good use of 'I'm not sure', 'for certain', and 'definitely'.
