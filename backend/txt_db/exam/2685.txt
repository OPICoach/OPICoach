Question 
Please tell me about the girl that you like.

Answer 
Uh, let me see, you know, I really like a girl because I love her face or I love her smile and I love her voice of laugh and so so whenever I listen to the music song called strawberry and cigarettes, I think of the girl who I like, you know. So, um, these days, whenever I listen to the music song, this song, I'm very feel down, you know.

Feedback 
Your answer is too short, only four sentences. Each sentence is too long, making it difficult to understand and breathe. Break down long sentences into multiple short sentences. For example, instead of one long sentence listing everything you like, use several short sentences like 'I really like this girl. She's so beautiful. Especially her smile. Whenever she smiles, I melt.' The phrase 'I really like a girl' is a bit awkward; 'I really like this girl' is more natural. The structure 'I love her face or I love her smile and I love her voice of laugh and so on' is repetitive and too long. Also, the grammar in 'I'm very feel down' is incorrect; it should be 'I feel very down' or 'I feel down'.
