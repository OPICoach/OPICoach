How are you?

Answer 
Pretty good, yourself?

Feedback 
The common textbook answer 'Fine, thank you. And you?' is grammatically correct but can sound unnatural or stiff to native speakers. A much more natural and frequently used response is 'Pretty good, yourself?'. 'Pretty good' is a very common and casual way to say you are doing well. 'Yourself?' is a smooth, concise way to ask the question back, replacing 'And you?' or 'How about you?'. For smoother pronunciation when asking back, practice linking sounds, for example, 'and you' can sound like 'and ju', and 'about you' can sound like 'about ju'. Additionally, using varied and sometimes humorous responses (such as 'Overworked and underpaid' or 'Fair with a bit of cloud') can make your English sound more natural, engaging, and show more personality.
