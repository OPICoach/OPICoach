Question 
What will you do over the weekend?

Answer 
I think I will go to my friend's second house. I can't wait to go there cuz there are really beautiful, you know, sky make you.

Feedback 
Instead of 'sky make you', you could say 'the area is very beautiful' or describe the environment. To express how it makes you feel, you can say 'It makes me feel relaxed' or 'It's like a place of Zen'.
