Question 
What will you do over the weekend?

Answer 
This weekend, I think, it's gonna be very boring. because I don't have any appointments.

Feedback 
Using 'appointments' for social plans with friends is less common. 'Appointments' are typically for formal meetings like with a doctor, dentist, or for a job interview (where a reservation is made). For meeting friends, it's more natural to say 'I have plans to meet a friend' or describe the activity directly, like 'I'm gonna go watch a movie with a close friend of mine'.
