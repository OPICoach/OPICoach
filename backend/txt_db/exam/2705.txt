Question 
You indicated in the survey that you travel internationally. Could you describe for me one of the countries you've visited? What did it look like and what were the people like there?

Answer 
I visited Japan before. It was very nice. There were many tall buildings and bright lights at night. The streets were clean and the weather was good. The people were kind and helped me when I asked. On the train people were quiet and used their phones. I ate ramen and it was delicious. I want to visit Japan again.

Feedback 
Good start with 'I visited Japan before' and 'It was very nice'. The use of 'very' adds a bit more feeling. However, the answer includes too many different points (tall buildings, bright lights, clean streets, good weather, kind people, quiet train behavior, delicious food). This is like having too many appetizers. It's better to focus on one main point (like food/sushi) and use other points as examples (M1, M2) if possible, or just focus on the main point and add specific details (color, numbers) in the concluding part (A).
