Question 
Tell me about a foreign country you visited when you were young. What was special about that visit? What do you remember doing?

Answer 
I visited China when I was young. It was my first time traveling abroad. I remember seeing the Great Wall and it was very big. I walked on it with my family and took many pictures. The food was different from what I ate at home, but I liked it. I tried their dumplings and some of their spicy dishes. There were many people everywhere and the streets were very busy. I also visited a big market and bought some souvenirs. It was a fun trip and I still remember it well.

Feedback 
Good job mentioning 'when I was young'. The start 'I visited China when I was young. It was my first time traveling abroad.' is clear. Focusing on the Great Wall initially is good. However, like the previous answer, it includes too many different points (Great Wall, food, people, souvenir shop). It's better to choose one main point (like the Great Wall) and use the others (food, people) as examples (M1, M2). Adding specific details like the grade level you were in ('grade three or something') makes it more specific. For the main point (Great Wall), adding details like its size using numbers (height, length) in the concluding part (A) would be effective. Including family members in the story is also good for past experiences.
