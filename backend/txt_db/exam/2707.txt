Question 
Describe the geography of your country. Are there mountains, lakes, or rivers? What is your country like?

Answer 
My country has mountains, rivers and lakes. Some areas have big mountains for hiking. There are wide rivers for fishing and boating. Lakes are great for swimming in the summer. The weather is different in each region. Cities are busy but the countryside is quiet. Overall my country has many landscapes.

Feedback 
Using the words from the question (mountains, rivers, lakes) is a good start. However, the answer lists all three examples and adds more (weather, cities/countryside, landscapes), covering too many points (six) in a short response. It's best to focus on one main point (e.g., mountains) and use the other examples (lakes, rivers) as secondary points (M1, M2). For the main point (mountains), add specific details like color (trees) or numbers (height, quantity) in the concluding part (A). Avoid using overly scripted or unnatural phrases about geography like 'peninsula' or exact numbers of mountains/bodies of water.
