Question 
You've indicated that you like to go to the beach. Describe your favorite beach for me. Where is it? What does it look like?

Answer 
Okay. Um, okay, let me describe to you straight. I'm really into beaches, especially nearby East Sea in country because I'm more of a surf person. I love going surfing. I'm telling you, there are tons of fascinated beaches in my country. But I'd like to tell you East Ocean. It's called 양양 beach because this place is so famous among surfers, including myself. Big wave, strong wide strong wind, brilliant sunshine. Wow, you can never go wrong with that beach. I love it. It's a perfect activities place to enjoy some water. Of course, a lot of activities entertain you on the beach. But if you hear the sounds of surf breaking, you can't wait to go surfing. So are you ready to have blue the ocean?

Feedback 
The answer attempts to follow the 6-step strategy but misses some key elements, particularly examples (Step 3), returning to the main point clearly (Step 4), providing insight (Step 5), and summarizing (Step 6). Specific feedback includes: 'let me describe to you straight' is awkward; suggest 'Let me describe to you my favorite beach' or 'Allow me to describe to you my favorite beach'. Be cautious with the pronunciation of 'beach'. 'nearby East Sea in country' is awkward; suggest 'the East coast of Korea'. 'I'm more of a surf person' implies comparison; simply stating 'because I love surfing' or 'because I'm a surf person' might be better. 'fascinated beaches' should be 'fascinating beaches'. 'East Ocean' is awkward; use 'East Sea' or preferably 'East coast'. 'activities place' is awkward; suggest 'place for activities' or 'place to enjoy activities'. 'activities entertain you' is awkward; suggest 'you can enjoy a lot of activities'. The ending 'So are you ready to have blue the ocean?' is very awkward and the summary step is missing.
