Answer 
Well, that's a good question. I, well, I got to say that here in Korea, they serve a whole lot of Japanese food. Um, I know it's quite interesting, right? But I, like personally, I like Japanese food as you know. And um, it just tastes so good. And I don't know what kind of seasonings they use or maybe the fresh ingredients. I don't know, you know, like just just a bit ago like uh 30 minutes ago, I had to take the food out like for to go. You know the salmon, like uh the salmon was calling my name, right? So I had this steamed rice with the salmon, like seasoned salmon and the and you know, I'm drooling like literally right now. So like overall, I think Koreans are really into Japanese food.       Well, you know, I just moved into a new place and the thing is that I bought you know, so big bat for my small place. So, you know what? Even though you know, I am living in a small, very small studio, but you know, my bat was queen size and when I just, you know, got it and when I just put it in my place, I just found it that it was just so big to my place and, you know, it actually accounts for almost half of my place. So, you know, I cuz you know what? I decided to just use it cuz even though it was too big, but still I loved it because, you know, I just could lie down on it and, you know, stretch my arms and, you know, legs so freely. So, yeah, that's what I did. I just decided to keep it and I just am still using it. And, you know what? Nowadays, when I stay at my place, the bat is pulling me to it cuz, you know, it is so big. So, yeah, I love my bat. That's all.

Feedback 
Overall, your answer is detailed and uses a good range of vocabulary and conversational expressions. You provide specific examples, which is excellent for OPIc. However, there are a few areas for improvement:

1.  **Typo:** You repeatedly say "bat" instead of "bed" when describing your furniture. This is a significant error that affects clarity.
2.  **Fillers:** You use "you know" and "like" quite frequently. While natural in conversation, try to reduce them slightly for a more polished sound. For example, instead of "I bought you know, so big bat," you could say "I bought such a big bed."
3.  **Phrasing:** Some phrases could be more natural:
    *   "I had to take the food out like for to go": More natural would be "I got takeout" or "I ordered food to go."
    *   "so big bat": Should be "such a big bed" or "a very big bed."
    *   "so big to my place": Better is "too big for my place."
    *   "the bat is pulling me to it": Assuming you mean "bed," a more natural phrase might be "the bed is so comfortable it's hard to leave" or "my bed is so big and comfortable."
4.  **Sentence Structure:** "I cuz you know what? I decided..." is a bit fragmented. You could say "So, you know what? I decided..." or "Because, you know what, I decided..."

Keep up the good use of descriptive language like "calling my name," "drooling," "accounts for almost half," and "stretch my arms and legs so freely." Focusing on correcting the typo and refining some phrases will make your response even stronger.
