Question 
You indicated that you go to a gym to work out What is the main purpose of you going to a gym? And when you do go what do you do? Please tell me everything

Answer 
Okay so these days I go to the gym every day every day yeah And whenever I go there I always always fill my water bottle. Of course I do a lot of things there like I work out my legs and my chest and sometimes I check trainers' bodies. So you know what I mean so whenever I work out I easily get thirsty. So water is super important to me. So that's why that's what I make sure to fill my water bottle.

Feedback 
The question asks about your main purpose and what you *do* (habit/action), not just describing the place (description). The student correctly focuses on an action: filling the water bottle. Key points: 1. Habit answers should focus on actions ('what do you do?') rather than just destinations ('where do you go?'). 2. Use frequency words like 'whenever' and 'always' to show habit. 'Whenever' is a particularly good '꿀 단어' for the habit category as it forces you to show action. 'Always' is a positive frequency word, good for starting practice. 3. The structure of the answer is good: main point (fill water bottle), brief mention of other activities (working out, checking trainers - the 1% rule), return to the main point and explain *why* it's important (get thirsty, water is important). 4. Using 'that's why' effectively connects the reason (getting thirsty, water is important) to the action (filling the bottle). 5. 'Important' is a good word to express feeling/evaluation when other specific emotions are hard to articulate. 6. The phrase 'I make sure to fill my water bottle' emphasizes the consistent action. 7. Pronunciation feedback: 'gym' should be pronounced /dʒɪm/, not /dʒɪm/. 8. Vocabulary note: 'blank out' (mind goes blank) is different from 'black out' (lose consciousness, often from alcohol). 9. Strategy note: Mentioning 'checking trainers' bodies' is a risky '변태 전략' that might work for female speakers at higher levels (IH+) but is generally not recommended for male speakers or lower levels, as it can sound inappropriate to the examiner. If used, it should be said quickly and followed by a phrase like 'anyways' or 'you know what I mean' to show a slightly embarrassed or casual attitude.
