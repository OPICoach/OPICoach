Question 
What kind of technology do you use the most these days? What is it? And what is it used for? Tell me in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
Um, I'm not tech savvy, but I use various types of technology in my life. And out of all the technologies I use, my cell phone the most. Advances in mobile technology made my life so much easier. I use my cell phone to listen to music, make phone calls, and surf the internet as well. I literally use it 24/7. Besides my cell phone, I use a computer every single day. It'll take all day to list the things I do with my computer. It's super fast and really convenient. I don't think I can survive even a day without them.

Feedback 
Start naturally with 'Um'. Use fancy expressions like 'tech savvy' for extra points. Mention using 'various types of technology'. Use the structure 'out of all the technologies I use, A the most'. Use 'advances' instead of 'development' for easier pronunciation. Use 'made my life so much easier'. Use emphasis with 'literally' and the expression '24/7' for 'always'. Use 'besides A' to introduce another item. Emphasize with 'every single day'. Use the expression 'It'll take all day to list the things I do with my computer'. Pronounce 'super' correctly, not 'super'. Use 'convenient' for convenient. Finish with a fancy expression like 'I don't think I can survive even a day without them'. Remember to pause appropriately when speaking.
