Question 
I'd like to know about the holidays in your country. What kind of holidays are celebrated in your country? How do people celebrate them? What are the special things about the holidays? Please tell me in detail.

Answer 
Well, you know, I think we've got quite a few traditional holidays that we celebrate, you know. I've got quite a few things to tell you about holidays in my country. Well, I would say some of them might be really similar to the ones in your country like New Year's Day, Thanksgiving Day or Christmas, you know. When you think of holidays, family gatherings and traditional food probably come to your mind. Let's take Christmas as an example. People exchange gifts, catch up with their family and just enjoy spending time together. But for these holidays, you know, supermarkets and department stores and malls get packed with people shopping for gifts for their loved ones. Personally, you know, I love the festive, heartwarming and cheerful atmosphere that these holidays bring. So I think holidays are like all about celebrating with our loved ones.

This is a description question. Focus on explaining the types of holidays, how they are celebrated, and their special characteristics. Avoid mixing in too much personal past experience. Use modals like 'might' and 'would'. Practice natural intonation and tempo; avoid sounding like you are reading or memorizing. Use descriptive vocabulary like 'packed', 'festive', 'heartwarming', 'cheerful'. Learn useful phrases for introduction and description such as 'I've got quite a few things to tell you', 'I would say', 'come to your mind', 'take A as an example', 'all about'.
