Question 
In your background survey, you indicated that you like to listen to music. Please tell me about your favorite music or singers.

Answer 
Start with a buffer like "I'm not sure where to start because I have a lot of favorite music genres." Mention being "a huge fan of hip hop" or other genres, calling it your "number one choice" or "go to type of music." Explain when and why you listen, e.g., "whenever I get tired of studying... I usually turn on hip hop music." Describe what you like about it, such as "intriguing lyrics" that "provide me with a lot of inspiration," or how "the music itself energizes me" and "makes me feel like hyped up." Mention a favorite artist you "really admire" and describe their style as "truly awesome and one of a kind." Introduce another genre you love, like K-pop, explaining why, such as "lyrics that I can relate to." Address potential counterarguments with "Some people might think... But I back to differ." Describe the unique charm of the lyrics or the "dazzling performances." Mention being "into various styles like rock, R&B, and things like that." Conclude by talking about the overall role of music, like finding "comfort in music all the time" because "it never fails to uplift my mood, especially during stressful moments."

Feedback 
Starting with a buffer like "I'm not sure where to start because..." is recommended to sound natural and avoid sounding memorized. Use expressions like "I'm a huge fan of" or "it's my go to" instead of just "like" for higher levels. "Get tired of" is a useful phrase for describing boredom or fatigue with something. Use AL vocabulary like "intriguing" (instead of interesting), "provide me with inspiration" (or give me inspiration), "energizes me," and "makes me feel like hyped up." "Another reason why... is" is a good AL pattern for varied sentence structure. "Admire" is stronger than "love" for respecting an artist. Use AL adverbs like "truly" with adjectives like "awesome." "One of a kind" is an excellent AL phrase for describing something unique or special, applicable to various topics. "Relate to" is common for connecting with lyrics or stories. "I back to differ" is an AL way to politely disagree. "Is mostly about" is an AL pattern to describe the main characteristic. Pay attention to the stress on "performances." When listing things like genres, vary your speed and intonation (e.g., "rock, you know, R&B, and things like that") rather than listing robotically. "Comforts me" and "uplift my mood" are good phrases for describing the emotional effect of music. "Never fails to uplift my mood" is an AL pattern.
