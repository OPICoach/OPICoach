Question 
How did you first become interested in music? What kind of music did you like when you were young? Why did you like to listen to that kind of music? How has your interest in music changed?

Answer 
Start with a buffer like "The question is a bit challenging for me to answer." State your long-standing interest using the present perfect: "I've always loved music." Talk about your childhood using past tense or "used to": "back in elementary school, I was obsessed with the cartoon theme songs." Mention singing them "every day" or "left and right." Describe your middle/high school phase: "in middle school I was really into K-pop." Explain why you liked it then: "their lyrics are so catchy," you would "often hum their songs," and the groups had "incredible dance performances" and "truly gifted voices." Mention how it helped you: "listening to K-pop songs would make studying enjoyable." Discuss how your taste has changed: "However these days I prefer classical music over K-pop." Explain why classical music is special: "what makes classical music so special is the stunning melodies without lyrics." Add other reasons like the musicians' skills providing "incredible emotion and inspiration." Mention occasionally listening to old music or remixes: "Sometimes I come across remixes of songs I used to listen to." Summarize the change (or lack thereof) using the present perfect: "to recap, my music taste has hardly changed" or "my music taste has changed from mostly enjoying K-pop to appreciating classical music." Add a nuance using "That being said, it doesn't mean I've completely stopped listening to K-pop," explaining when you still listen, e.g., "when I work out, lively K-pop still helps me focus."

Feedback 
Using a buffer like "a bit challenging" or "somewhat challenging" is good. The question asks "How did you..." requiring past tense. Using the present perfect like "I've always loved" is important for AL to show ability to connect past and present. "Back in elementary school" is an alternative to "When I was...". "Obsessed with" is a strong expression for intense liking. "Used to" is very useful for past habits/states, especially if you forget the past tense form of a verb. "Left and right" is an idiom meaning frequently or everywhere. "Was really into" is the past tense of "be into" (interested in). "Catchy" describes memorable songs. "Hum" means singing with closed lips. Use AL adverbs like "incredible" and "truly gifted." "Would make studying enjoyable" uses "would" for a past habitual result and "enjoyable" is good vocabulary. "Prefer A over B" or "prefer A to B" is the correct structure for "prefer." "Has become my joy" is more natural than "healing time." "Classical music" is the standard term. "What makes X so special is Y" is an AL pattern. "Stunning" is good vocabulary for impressive things. "Besides" is an AL connective. "Come across" means to find by chance. Use "TV shows" instead of "TV drama." "To recap" is for summarizing. "Has hardly changed" uses "hardly" (almost not) and present perfect. "Throughout my life" connects past to present. "Anyway um" is a natural transition. "That being said" means "despite that," useful for adding a contrasting point. Use -ly adverbs like "completely." "Lively" describes energetic music. Pay attention to intonation and stress; avoid rising intonation at the end of sentences to sound natural and fluent.
