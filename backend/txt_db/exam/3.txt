Question 
Step 3: Repeat the response.

Answer 
Oh, that cheap. Oh, thank you.

Feedback 
This is step three: repeating the response to show dialogue. Minjin's reaction 'Oh, that cheap' and 'Oh, thank you' is nice. The problem is not repeating *what* the other person said. Recommended structure: Reaction + Repeat Response + Feeling. Example: 'Oh, that cheap? Only $1,000? Thatâ€™s great.'
