Question 
Tell me about your home. What does it look like? How many rooms does it have? Give me all the details.

Answer 
All right. let me tell you about where I live. I live alone in a small apartment in Seoul, Korea. Actually, it's a studio apartment, so there's no separate bedroom in my place. Although it's a small studio apartment, it has a nice bathroom, a small kitchen area, and a balcony. I like that my apartment is very clean and modern. This is because it was recently renovated with modern interiors. In addition, what makes my apartment special is a big window. There's a large window which lets in a lot of light. You know, it makes my apartment super bright. especially in the morning. And I feel like the sunshine always wakes me up. I love it. So, overall, I like my current home and I can say it's a perfect place for me. And I'm happy with where I live now.

Feedback 
Excellent description of your home, covering its type, size, rooms, and features. Good use of descriptive words like 'clean,' 'modern,' 'renovated,' 'spacious,' and 'bright.' The phrase 'lets in a lot of light' is natural. 'You know' is a common filler but doesn't detract significantly. The conclusion about feeling happy with your home is a nice touch.
