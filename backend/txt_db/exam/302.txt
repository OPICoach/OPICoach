Question 
Have you made any changes to your home? What kind of changes have you made? Are you satisfied with the changes?

Answer 
Oh, well, honestly, I haven't made any changes to my home recently. Yeah, I mean, like I said in the previous question, I live alone in a small apartment, so I'm not very interested in making changes to my apartment. Besides, I'm just kind of lazy. I don't feel like doing anything when I'm at home. Hmm. But maybe I can tell you about my new table? Recently, I bought a new coffee table. I got it from IKEA a few months ago and it was about $100. Well, I think it was a good buy because I got a 15% discount. Anyway, I put the table by the window, so now I can enjoy the sunshine drinking coffee in the morning. Well, I guess that's it.

Feedback 
You directly addressed the question by stating you haven't made major changes. Providing the reason (small apartment, not interested, lazy) is good. Shifting to a recent purchase (the coffee table) is a smart way to provide relevant detail when a direct answer is limited. Specific details like 'IKEA,' '$100,' '15% discount,' and where you put it are great. 'Kind of lazy' and 'Hmm' are natural hesitations.
