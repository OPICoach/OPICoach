Question 
Compare the home you lived in before to the one you live now. What are the differences between the two homes? Describe in details.

Answer 
I have to say this is a complicated question because I can't quite remember the home I lived in before. I mean, when I was young, I lived with my parents in a big house. But honestly, it's a long time ago. So I don't remember what it was like. As far as I remember, in my parents' house, there were four bedrooms, a spacious kitchen area, and two bathrooms. Back then, my parents had a lot of furniture and appliances too. But now, I live alone in a studio apartment, so I don't have a bedroom in my place. Honestly, my apartment is not as big as my parents' house. You know, it's a small studio. However, I like that it's really cozy and comfortable. I can say I always feel relaxed when I'm home.

Feedback 
Acknowledging the difficulty of the question ('complicated question,' 'can't quite remember') is acceptable. You still managed to provide a good comparison by contrasting the old house (size, rooms, living with parents, furniture) with your current studio apartment (size, living alone, no bedroom). Phrases like 'As far as I remember' and 'not as big as' are useful for comparison. 'You know' is a filler. Ending with how you feel about your current home ('cozy and comfortable,' 'relaxed') is a good personal touch.
