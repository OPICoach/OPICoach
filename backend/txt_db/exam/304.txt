Question 
I would like to know about the recycling system in your country. How do people in your country recycle? What kind of items do they recycle? Give me all the details.

Answer 
Oh my gosh, recycling? This is a really hard one. Honestly, I've no idea about this topic. I mean, I haven't thought about the recycling system in my country. So, I'm sorry, but could you give me some time to think about it? Hmm. Well, I don't really know about the recycling system in Korea. Yeah, I'm not really sure. But I do know that it's mandatory in Korea. Recycling is very well practiced in Korea and it's become a daily routine in people's lives.

Feedback 
You clearly expressed difficulty with this topic ('really hard one,' 'no idea,' 'not really sure'). While honesty is fine, explicitly stating you don't know much or asking for time limits the depth of your answer. You did manage to provide some general facts ('mandatory,' 'well practiced,' 'daily routine'), which is better than saying absolutely nothing. For future reference, try to connect even limited knowledge to personal experience or general observations if possible.
