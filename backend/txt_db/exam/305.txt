Question 
How do you recycle at home? How often do you take out recyclable items? Describe the recycling process.

Answer 
Well, honestly, I hardly recycle at home. Yeah, I I don't do much recycling because I don't cook at home. Besides, I often eat out, so there's not a lot of recycling to do at home. I guess I recycle every two weeks. I try to gather the recyclable items like aluminum, glass, plastic, and paper. And I take them out separately. My apartment complex has a recycling day and the city collects the items on a certain day. Well, I guess that's all I can think of.

Feedback 
You directly addressed the question about your personal recycling habits, explaining why you don't do much ('hardly recycle,' 'don't cook,' 'eat out'). You provided a frequency ('every two weeks') and listed common recyclable items. Describing the process briefly (gather, take out separately, apartment complex day, city collects) is good. 'Yeah, I I don't do much' has a slight repetition. 'Well, I guess that's all I can think of' is a common closing phrase.
