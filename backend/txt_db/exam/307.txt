Question 
I'd like to give you a situation to act out. You want to invite your friend to the park. Call your friend to ask about going to the park with you. Ask three or four questions about the plan.

Answer 
Ring ring. Ring ring. Hello? Hey, hi Jenny. How's it going? Yeah, I'm pretty good. Nothing much. Hey, so I was wondering, what are you up to tomorrow? I'm thinking about going to Han River Park tomorrow afternoon. I kind of want to ride a bike or jog or something. Do you want to come? Oh good, perfect. So what time should we meet? All right then. Let's get something to eat first and then ride a bike. Sure. 12:30 sounds good to me. So, are you going to bring your bike? Yeah, I'm going to ride mine too. Awesome. Oh wait, I can pick you up, you know? Yeah, sure. I'll pick you up around 12:15. Cool. Okay Jenny. See you tomorrow. Bye. Love you.

Feedback 
Excellent roleplay! You started with sound effects and a natural greeting. You checked availability and made a clear invitation. You successfully asked multiple questions about the plan ('what time should we meet?', 'Are you going to bring your bike?', 'I can pick you up?'). The dialogue flows very naturally, using common informal phrases ('How's it going?', 'pretty good,' 'Nothing much,' 'kind of want to,' 'sounds good to me,' 'Awesome,' 'Cool'). Ending with 'Love you' adds a realistic touch for a close friend.
