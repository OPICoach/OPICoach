Question 
What is your favorite type of movies? Why do you like those movies? Describe in details.

Answer 
Well, I have to say this is a good question because I love watching movies. Actually, I'm not so picky about movies, so basically I watch all genres of movies including actions, thrillers, science fictions, and romances. Among all these genres, I would say I enjoy science fictions the most. You know, a lot of sci-fi movies focus on ideas that are really out there, such as the universe, time travel, dreams, things like that. I like that sci-fi movies are so creative, imaginative, and thought-provoking. And also, sci-fi movies feature advanced special effects and I love to enjoy all those amazing effects and the CGI work on a big screen at a theater. Speaking of sci-fi, one of my favorite sci-fi movies is Inception. Inception is a famous sci-fi thriller movie directed by Christopher Nolan. It's about dreams, dreaming in dreams, and even stealing dreams. The plot of Interstellar is just so original and creative. So, if you also enjoy sci-fi, I highly recommend watching Inception.

Feedback 
Excellent answer! You started by acknowledging the question and stating your general love for movies. You listed various genres before specifying your favorite, science fiction. You provided clear reasons for liking sci-fi (creative, imaginative, thought-provoking ideas, advanced special effects, CGI). You used good vocabulary like 'picky', 'genres', 'thought-provoking', 'feature', 'advanced special effects', 'CGI work'. You gave a specific example (Inception), described its plot, and recommended it. One minor point: you mentioned 'The plot of Interstellar' when talking about Inception. This seems like a slight mix-up, perhaps you meant 'The plot of Inception' or were thinking of Nolan's other work, Interstellar, which you mention later. Overall, a well-structured and detailed response.
