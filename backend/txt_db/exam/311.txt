Question 
Who's your favorite actor? Why do you like him or her? What movies has this actor starred in? Tell me everything in details.

Answer 
As I said in the previous question, I love watching all types of movies, so I know a lot of great actors. There are so many actors and actresses I admire, but I'd like to talk about Anne Hathaway. I'm a huge fan of Anne Hathaway, who is one of the most famous American actresses. She's an award-winning actress who has played many different roles in dramas, comedies, and science fictions. She has starred in a lot of great films including Interstellar, The Devil Wears Prada, The Intern, The Princess Diaries, etc. I think she always looks gorgeous. What's more, she's got incredible acting skills, which makes her even more amazing. You should definitely check out her movie like The Devil Wears Prada.

Feedback 
Very good answer. You linked it nicely to the previous question about movies. You introduced your favorite actress, Anne Hathaway, and provided solid reasons for liking her (award-winning, versatile roles, gorgeous appearance, incredible acting skills). You listed several of her well-known movies. Vocabulary like 'admire', 'award-winning', 'starred in', 'gorgeous', and 'incredible acting skills' are used effectively. The phrase 'What's more' is a good transition. The sentence structure is clear and flows well.
