Question 
I would like to know about restaurants you often go to. What are they like and what kind of food do they serve? How often do you go there?

Answer 
I really like eating out, so I've been to a lot of nice restaurants in my country. Actually, I live in a big city, Seoul, so restaurants are all over the place. I can say I know several decent restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. So maybe I could choose one of my favorite places and tell you about that place. Speaking of my favorite restaurant, I'd like to talk about my favorite brunch place. It's called Jenna's Cafe, which is pretty close to where I live. Um, it's only about a 10 to 15 minute walk from my place, so I tend to go there a lot on weekends. Well, this restaurant is kind of small, but it has really nice vibes and awesome open terrace. And also, what makes Jenna's Cafe special is that they have excellent pizza. I love their menu, especially their Margarita pizza. You can't imagine how tasty it is. Oh, they serve really good French toast with coffee for breakfast. But I normally get pizza there. So, overall, I feel very lucky to have such a decent restaurant in my town. Honestly, it gets a little busy on weekends because it has got more popular recently, but I love its cozy and cheerful atmosphere.

Feedback 
Great answer. You started broadly about eating out in Seoul and then focused on a specific favorite, Jenna's Cafe. You described its location, frequency of visits ('a lot on weekends'), atmosphere ('nice vibes', 'awesome open terrace', 'cozy and cheerful atmosphere'), and specific food items (pizza, Margarita pizza, French toast). You used good descriptive vocabulary like 'all over the place', 'decent', 'vibes', 'terrace', 'tasty', 'cozy', and 'cheerful'. You also mentioned a recent change (getting busier). The structure is logical, moving from general to specific details.
