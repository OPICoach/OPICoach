Question 
Can you tell me about a restaurant you went to recently? What kind of restaurant was it and what was their menu? What did you eat there? Did you like the food you ate there?

Answer 
Oh, wow. This is a very hard one because I haven't eaten out so much lately. You know, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, I've been eating most of my meals at home. I would try and cook healthy meals at home sometimes, but mostly, I tend to get food delivered. This is because I'm so busy with work that I don't have time to cook during the week. So, maybe I can tell you about one of the delivery restaurants I got food from. So, the other day, I got fried chicken and mozzarella salad delivered from Hacker's Dining. It's a local restaurant which only offers delivery food. The food I ordered tasted super good because I guess I was starving that night. Oh, you know what? I have the leftovers in the fridge and that's gonna be my dinner tonight.

Feedback 
Excellent adaptation to the question. You explained why answering about a recent *dine-in* experience was difficult due to the pandemic and your busy schedule, and then shifted to talking about a recent *delivery* experience, which is a perfectly valid interpretation in the current context. You named the place (Hacker's Dining), described its type (delivery-only), mentioned what you ordered (fried chicken, mozzarella salad), and commented on the taste ('super good', linking it to being 'starving'). The ending about leftovers is a nice, natural touch. Vocabulary like 'lately', 'pandemic', 'delivered', 'starving', and 'leftovers' are appropriate. The conversational phrases like 'Oh, wow', 'You know', and 'Oh, you know what?' make it sound very natural.
