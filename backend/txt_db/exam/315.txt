Question 
Tell me about a restaurant you used to eat out as a child. What was it like? What did you use to eat there? What makes the place so memorable? Explain in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
Hmm, a restaurant I used to go to as a child? Let's see. You know, that's a long time ago, so I need some time to think about this. Well, when I was a kid, I didn't eat out as much as I do now as an adult. Back then, my mom used to cook for my family all the time. Of course, my family would go out for dinner sometimes, but I don't quite remember a specific restaurant I used to go to. Hmm, let's see. Oh yeah, I remember going to McDonald's as a child. My friends and I used to go there after school to get cheeseburger or French fries. I still remember how good the food was. I mean, I still go to McDonald's once in a while, but the food there doesn't taste as good as it did when I was a kid.

Feedback 
Good answer. You realistically conveyed the process of trying to remember something from childhood, explaining that you didn't eat out as much back then. You mentioned your mom's cooking as the norm. While you initially struggled to recall a specific restaurant, you successfully remembered McDonald's. You described the context of going there (after school with friends) and what you ate (cheeseburger, French fries). The comparison of the taste then versus now is a nice detail that adds depth and makes it memorable. Vocabulary like 'used to', 'back then', 'quite remember', and 'once in a while' are used correctly to talk about past habits and memories. The thinking sounds like 'Hmm', 'Let's see', 'You know' are natural.
