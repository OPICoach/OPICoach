Question 
I'd like to give you a situation to act out. You want to invite your friend to the beach. Call your friend to ask about going to the beach with you. Ask three or four questions about the trip you're planning.

Answer 
Ring ring, ring ring. Hello? Hey, hi Jessie. How's it going? I'm good. I just got home from work. I'm excited, it's Friday tomorrow. Yeah, right? So, I was wondering, are you doing anything this weekend? I'm thinking about going to the beach we met last summer. Maybe you could join me if you're free on Saturday afternoon. Oh, you're available that day? Perfect. So, what time should we meet? Okay. And what do you want to do at the beach? Sure, we should definitely get some raw fish there. I've read there are some nice seafood restaurants and bars opened last month. We should check them out. Awesome. All right, so let me know what time we should meet up on Saturday. Okay. Talk to you later. Bye.

Feedback 
Excellent role-play. You started realistically with phone sounds and greetings. You clearly stated the purpose of your call (inviting to the beach). You asked relevant planning questions about the trip: 'are you doing anything this weekend?', 'what time should we meet?', 'what do you want to do at the beach?', and suggested an activity ('get some raw fish', 'check out seafood restaurants'). You reacted naturally to the friend's implied responses ('Oh, you're available that day? Perfect.', 'Sure, we should definitely...'). The language is very natural and conversational, using phrases like 'How's it going?', 'I was wondering', 'thinking about', 'Maybe you could join me', 'check them out', 'Awesome', 'All right', 'meet up', 'Talk to you later'. This demonstrates strong fluency in a social context.
