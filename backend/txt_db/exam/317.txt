Question 
There's a problem you need to resolve. You found out that the weather will be bad this weekend. Call your friend to postpone the beach trip and give two or three alternatives.

Answer 
Ring ring, ring ring. Hey Jessie, it's me, Jenna again. I'm calling because we've got some bad news. I was just watching the news and I heard the weather will be bad on Saturday. Yeah, it'll rain all weekend. So, I was thinking it might not be a good idea to go to the beach this weekend. So, maybe we can try and go next weekend? Sure, but we should still hang out, right? What do you want to do? How about we go to the movies? Or maybe we could just grab some drinks or hang out in my place. Yeah, we've got some time. So, let's think about it. All right. Bye.

Feedback 
Excellent role-play for problem-solving. You started with phone sounds and a clear statement of the problem ('we've got some bad news', 'weather will be bad', 'it'll rain all weekend'). You explained why the original plan wasn't feasible ('might not be a good idea to go to the beach'). You proposed postponing the trip ('maybe we can try and go next weekend?'). Crucially, you offered alternatives for still hanging out ('How about we go to the movies?', 'maybe we could just grab some drinks or hang out in my place'). The language is natural and appropriate for the situation, using phrases like 'got some bad news', 'thinking it might not be a good idea', 'postpone', 'hang out', 'grab some drinks'. You handled the situation smoothly and offered concrete alternative plans.
