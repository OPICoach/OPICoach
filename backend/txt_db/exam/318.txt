Question 
You indicated in the survey that you like to go camping. What kind of activities do you like to do when you go camping? Tell me everything you do on a camping trip.

Answer 
All right, this is a pretty good question because I love to go camping. I normally go camping with my family and we usually go in the spring when it gets warm. So when my family and I go camping, we like to walk around the campground and enjoy nature. You know, there are many beautiful campgrounds in the mountains, so we like to walk along the trees, enjoy the scenery and get some fresh air. Oh, and when it gets dark, um the most fun part of our camping trip begins. That is a barbecue dinner. Back at our campsite, we set up all the camping gear like a camping stove, a table and chairs, and we grill lots of meat and vegetables. Eating grilled beef and vegetables outdoors is always a lot of fun. Sometimes we set up a campfire, gather around the campfire and play some music with a Bluetooth speaker. Camping is always a fun experience and it's one of my favorite ways to get rid of stress.
