Question 
What kind of items do you bring along when you go camping? Do you bring food on a camping trip? How do you prepare food when you go camping? Give me all the details.

Answer 
When I go on trips, I tend to pack a lot of things. Yeah, honestly, I'm kind of a heavy packer. So, I've been trying to pack only the things I need. But you know, when I go camping, I like to prepare a lot of food. Yeah, I love to eat a lot on a camping trip. I can say barbecue dinner is the best part of a camping trip. So, speaking of the food for camping, I like to prepare beef and vegetable skewers. I usually add some marinated beef, bell peppers, garlic, and zucchini. You know what? The skewers I make are always so good. I have my own recipe. Just talking about it makes my mouth watering right now. In addition, I pack some drinks like beer or wine and some snacks like marshmallows, chocolate, and biscuits. Sounds like a lot of food, right? As for the items I bring for a camping trip, I usually pack a tent, a sleeping bag, and a mat. On top of that, I bring a portable folding table and chairs so I can set up the food for dinner. I guess that's pretty much it.
