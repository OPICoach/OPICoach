Question 
Tell me about a memorable experience you had on a camping trip. Where did you go and who were you with? What made the experience so special? Describe in details.

Answer 
I remember a time when I went camping with my family last year. It was last summer in July. My family and I went camping to this beautiful campground in Jiri Mountain and spent a night there. It was kind of hot during the day because you know, it was in July. Although it was very hot, we decided to go trekking near our campground. The mountain was full of trees and flowers, so we had a really good time walking and taking a lot of pictures and videos. It was a lot of fun spending time in nature. Later that day, we had a barbecue dinner back at our campsite. We grilled some beef, sausages, and lots of vegetables like mushrooms, onions, and sweet potatoes. Everything was so delicious. So, I remember all of us ate a lot that night. Oh yeah, we had some beer and wine too. It was such a perfect dinner and a lovely night. I can't wait for my next camping trip with my family.
