Question 
I would like to know about one of your friends or family members. What does he or she look like?

Answer 
Oh wow, my family or friends? Hmm, let's see. It's hard to choose one person. Okay, I'd like to talk about one of my best friends. Yes. Let me tell you about my bestie, Jenny. So, speaking of her appearance, I think she's very pretty. Jenny has an oval face and beautiful big eyes. Maybe that's why she's so photogenic. Also, I feel like her outfits are always so cute. I mean, she's really fashionable, so I like to take her when I go shopping. What else? Um, oh, you know what? Jenny is one of the healthiest people I know. Seriously, she always eats healthy and drinks a lot of water. I'm impressed with her lifestyle, especially with her diet. She keeps a balanced diet with lots of fruits and vegetables. Sometimes we go out to eat at a healthy salad bar. Well, anyway, I'll have to say she's my good friend. I feel like there's more to say about Jenny, but I'll wrap it up here.
