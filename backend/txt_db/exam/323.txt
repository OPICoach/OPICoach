Question 
When was the last time you met up with your friend or family? Who did you meet and what did you do? Tell me everything you did from beginning to end.

Answer 
Well, I'd like to talk about the last time I invited my family to my home. It was on Christmas Eve last winter. I invited my family to my place so we could spend Christmas together. So my family came over to my place around noon and we had such a great relaxing day. I guess we didn't do anything too active because we were all kind of tired. And besides, it was pretty cold outside. Well, we decided to just stay at home and relax. We talked a lot, drinking hot tea with some cookies. You know, it was Christmas Eve, so I had baked Christmas cookies for my family and everyone loved the cookies I made. In addition, later in the evening, I made pizza, pasta, and salad for dinner. It was my first time baking pizza, but it was quite successful. My family all liked food and we ate a lot. I remember we were like, oh my gosh, I'm so full. I can't eat anymore. Yeah, everybody ate a lot because you know, it was a holiday week. I guess we didn't do anything special, but it was such a fun and relaxing holiday.
