Question 
Tell me about a memorable holiday you spent with your friends or family. What did you do that made it so memorable?

Answer 
A memorable experience on a holiday? Well, um, let's see. I need a second to think about it. All right. I remember a time when I stayed at Westin Chosun Hotel in Busan, Korea. So it was a couple years ago during my vacation with my best friend Jenny. First of all, Westin Chosun was a very nice five-star hotel located by the beach in Busan. So the ocean view from the room was incredible. In addition, the hotel lobby was nicely decorated with flowers and the smell of the hotel was so lovely. Actually, what made our stay so memorable was their excellent food and facilities. Yeah, the food at the hotel was absolutely delicious. There was a famous buffet restaurant where we went for lunch and my friend and I had such a great meal sitting by the ocean. What's more, later in the afternoon, we swam in the pool, walked around the hotel, and just relaxed and watched a movie in the room. Well, yeah, we didn't really do anything special, but I feel like it was such a relaxing and fun vacation. I have to say Westin Chosun is one of the nicest hotels I've ever been.
