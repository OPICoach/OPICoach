Question 
I'm going to give you a situation to act out. You would like to buy an MP3 player. Ask your friend about his or her MP3 player. Ask three or four questions that can help you decide if you want to buy the same product.

Answer 
Hey Minsoo, how's it going? I'm good. Yeah, it's good to see you. Actually, I'm thinking about getting a new MP3 player. So, I have some questions about yours. I was wondering, how much was your MP3 player? I don't need an expensive one. Actually, my budget is about $50. Oh really? That's not very expensive. Also, does it have a voice recorder? Oh, there is. That's awesome. Is it easy to use it? Oh cool, that would be great. And one more thing. What is the storage capacity? I need a model with at least 100 gigabyte. Oh wow, it actually sounds like a perfect one for me. Honestly, I think your MP3 player is a really good one. Maybe I should look up online and check the prices and reviews. Well, anyway, thank you for the information. That was really helpful.
