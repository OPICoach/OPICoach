Question 
I have a problem for you to take care of. You've borrowed an MP3 player from a friend, but you've broken it by mistake. Call your friend to explain what happened and offer two or three alternatives to the problem.

Answer 
Ring ring, ring ring. Hi Minsoo, it's me, Jenna. How's it going? I'm all right, nothing much. I'm calling because I have some bad news to share with you. You know the MP3 player I borrowed? Well, I was using it yesterday, but it fell out of my pocket while I was walking down the street. So I'm afraid the screen shattered. I'm really sorry. I feel so bad right now. Um, I was wondering, is your MP3 player still under warranty? You know, I can send it to the company for repair. Oh really? Then another thing we could do is take it to the repair shop. You know, it was my fault, so I can pay for everything. Sure, I can look up a good repair shop nearby. But you know, if you need your MP3 player right away, I can buy you a new one today. Yeah, let me know the model so I can look it up and buy the same one. I'm so sorry. So, think about it and give me a call when you decide.
