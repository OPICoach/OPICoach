Question 
Tell me about the furniture that you had in your childhood home. Was there anything different from the furniture that you have today? Describe for me what your home looked like at the time.

Answer 
Okay, well, you know, I have a lot of furniture at home, like a lot. And so, to keep this answer short, I'll focus on a piece of furniture that I absolutely hate these days. It's my chair. I really hate it because, you know, the cushion is super uncomfortable. It's not soft at all. I don't know why I bought it, honestly. I must have been crazy. But in the past, when I was a kid, I had a chair in my room, and I loved that chair. The cushion was super comfortable, you know? I could sit there for hours and even fall asleep sometimes. It was so nice. But yeah, my current chair is totally different. It's just... terrible. So, yeah, that's the main difference.

Feedback 
Excellent use of the comparison strategy! You clearly showed the contrast between your current chair (hate, uncomfortable) and your childhood chair (love, comfortable). Focusing on one specific furniture item like the chair, as discussed, is a great way to manage time and provide detail. You successfully avoided talking about appliances or electronics. Your use of phrases like "a lot of furniture, like a lot," "to keep this answer short," and fillers like "you know" makes the answer sound very natural and conversational. The strong language and exaggeration ("absolutely hate," "super uncomfortable," "not soft at all," "don't know why I bought it," "must have been crazy") effectively convey your feelings and add depth. The phrase "at all" is used correctly for emphasis. Overall, this answer effectively applies the comparison strategy and incorporates many useful expressions and fillers discussed in the lesson.
