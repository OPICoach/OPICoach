Feedback 
This question asks for a description (`look like`). Use the present tense. You can ignore the phrase 'in as much detail as possible'. The suggested expressions are versatile and can be used to describe other places as well. Focus on simple spatial descriptions like 'on the left' and 'on the right'.
