Question 
Tell me about a time something interesting or unexpected happened at a bank.

Answer 
Strategy: Tell a memorable experience using the past tense. It's strategic to have a versatile story that can be adapted. Key expressions: I had a once in a lifetime experience when visiting [Bank Name], It was the worst/most exciting experience in my life, Can you believe it? (to add liveliness). If you don't have a specific experience, use a '돌려막기' (substitution) strategy: I am so sorry about, I do not have a memorable experience at a bank. Instead I will talk about the last time I visited a bank (or the first time).

Feedback 
This question requires a past tense response about a specific event. 'Once in a lifetime' is a 'fancy expression' that can boost your score. 'Can you believe it?' helps make your storytelling more engaging. If you lack a specific story, it's acceptable to substitute with a description of your last or first visit, but deliver it sincerely ('I am so sorry about...') rather than sounding like you're just trying to fill time.
