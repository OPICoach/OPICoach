Question 
Do you talk a lot on the phone? Who do you talk to? What do you talk about? What do you usually talk about?

Answer 
Yes, I talk a lot on the phone. When I go home, I usually call my friends from high school. I can relieve my stress and collect my thoughts by talking about our day. Another person I call is my neighbor. I sometimes call her to say hi and catch up with each other. It's so much fun to talk on the phone that it became a must for me.

Feedback 
This is a question about your routine, so use the present tense. Think about the 5W1H (who, what, where, etc.). You can talk about different people you call to make your answer richer. Useful expressions: relieve my stress, collect my thoughts, talk about our day, say hi (안부를 전하다), catch up with each other, became a must for me.
