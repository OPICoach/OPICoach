Question 
Do you remember the first time you used a mobile phone? When was it? You might have experienced some changed in your daily life as a result of using a mobile phone. What changed have you experienced?

Answer 
The first time I got a cell phone was when I was eight. My parents bought it for me as a birthday gift. When I got my cell phone for the first time, I was so excited. Since then, I carry my cell phone with me all the time. I often sleep late at night because I play cell phone games too late. I should fix my habit and sleep early.

Feedback 
This question asks about a past experience (the first time), so use the past tense for that part. When talking about current habits or changes, use the present tense. Useful expressions: The first time I... was when I was..., My parents bought it for me as a birthday gift, since then, late at night, for the first time, 24/7.
