Question 
Please tell me about something funny or surprising that happened while you were talking on the phone. What was it? Who were you talking with? Why was it so interesting?

Answer 
One day, I was talking on the phone with my friend while I was on my way to a bank. While walking, I ran into one of my old friends. I couldn't believe my eyes. He told me he was shopping with his family. We met for a drink that night. It was an amazing experience. We became even better friends after that.

Feedback 
This is a question about a memorable past experience, so use the past tense. You can use a versatile script that can be adapted to different topics (e.g., meeting a friend unexpectedly). Focus on natural delivery rather than worrying about using the same script as others. Useful expressions: one day, I was on my way to..., I ran into (우연히 만나다), I couldn't believe my eyes, It was an amazing experience, We became even better friends after that.
