Question 
Certain holidays are more important than others. What is the biggest holiday in your country? Tell me what you usually do on that holiday and how you celebrate it.

Answer 
The biggest holiday in Korea is Lunar New Year's Day. My family and relatives go to my grandfather's house and eat a lot of traditional food, such as a rice cake and Korean pancake. oh and we also play traditional Korean game, such as a go stop, which is a card game. We sometimes make a bet on getting a high score. We also bow to elders and get pocket money and get words of blessing. These are the activities we do on Lunar New Year's Day.

Feedback 
This question specifically asks what 'you' usually do, so the subject should be 'I', 'my family and I', or 'we'. It asks about your routine or habits during the holiday. Use the present tense. Think about the 5W1H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) to structure your answer about your routine. Key vocabulary and phrases: relatives (pronunciation: relatives), go to my grandfather's house, eat a lot of traditional food, such as/like, a rice cake (떡국), Korean pancake (전), play traditional Korean game, go stop, which is a card game, make a bet on getting a high score, bow to elders (절하다), get pocket money (용돈을 받다), get words of blessing (덕담을 듣다), bow (인사하다/절하다), These are the activities. Strategy: List multiple activities you typically do. Dividing your answer into different activity points makes it sound richer.
