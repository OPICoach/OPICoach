Question 
Can you tell me about a particularly memorable holiday you had when you were young? Describe what you did and what made it so memorable. Give me as many details as you can.

Answer 
Yes. I had a memorable experience last year. last year I got $500 from my parents on Lunar New Year's Day. It was a lot of money. So I wanted to deposit the money on the following morning. I was on my way to and I saw someone familiar walking by me. I looked at his face and I couldn't believe my eyes. It was Sam. We went to the same high school. He told me he was on his way to a bank as well. We met for a drink. Since then, we keep in touch via Instagram.

Feedback 
This question asks about a past experience, specifically a memorable holiday when you were young. Use the past tense consistently. The word 'memorable' is a strong indicator of an experience question. OPIc often uses 'combo' questions, where related topics appear together. Strategy: Prepare a 'template' story about a memorable experience that can be adapted to different topics (like holidays, banks, parks, etc.). You might want to prepare 1-2 such templates. Key vocabulary and phrases: memorable experience, last year, got $500, from my parents, on Lunar New Year's Day, It was a lot of money, wanted to deposit the money (pronunciation: wanted to), on the following morning, I was on my way to (어디 가는 길이었다), saw someone familiar (익숙한 사람), walking by me, couldn't believe my eyes (내 눈을 믿을 수 없었다), went to the same high school, as well (뭐뭐도/또한), met for a drink (술 마시려고 만났다 - note: discard phrases that don't feel natural), running into someone you know (optional phrase), it was an amazing experience, Since then (그 후는), keep in touch (연락하고 지내다), via/via (뭐뭐를 통해서), SNS (incorrect, use social media or specific platforms like Instagram, Facebook). Focus on delivery and practicing speaking parts quickly.
