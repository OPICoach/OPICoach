Question 
Step 4: Ask your second question.

Answer 
But I want to I really want to buy pink iPhone 10. So do you have um pink one?

Feedback 
Nice introduction before the question. 'I really want to' is excellent. 'iPhone X' instead of 'iPhone 10'. The question 'So, do you have a pink one?' is good. Recommended phrasing for color: 'Does it come in pink?' This is a very natural way.
