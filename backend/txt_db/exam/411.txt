Question 
Tell me about a memorable experience you had.

Answer 
Once, I purchased a smartphone online, expecting top-notch performance based on the advertised specifications. However, upon receiving it, I realized the battery life was significantly shorter than expected, and the camera quality was subpar. Despite the promising features listed, they didn't meet my standard. It was frustrating because I heavily relied on these aspects for work and personal use. I had to go through the hassle of returning the device and finding an alternative that better suited my needs, emphasizing the importance of thorough research before making tech purchases.
