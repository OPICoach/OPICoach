Question 
Tell me about a memorable experience you had.

Answer 
Yes, I remember a time when I had planned a trip to attend a music festival with some friends during the summer. We had bought the concert tickets months in advance and were eagerly looking forward to it. However, just a week before the trip, an unexpected family emergency arose, and I had to cancel my plans at the last minute. I immediately contacted my friends and informed them about the situation. They were understanding but disappointed, as we had all been excited about it. Then, I reached out to the festival organizers to inquire about the possibility of getting a refund or rescheduling the tickets. Thankfully, they had a policy for emergencies like mine, and they allowed me to either get a refund or transfer my tickets to next year's festival. After weighing my options, I decided to transfer my tickets to the next year's event since I didn't want to miss out on the experience entirely. I made sure to note the new dates and put them in my calendar. Although it was disappointing to miss out with my friends, I was relieved that I could still attend the festival the following year. It taught me the importance of being flexible and proactive when dealing with unexpected changes in plans.
