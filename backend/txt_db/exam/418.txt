Question 
Tell me about a memorable experience you had.

Answer 
During a vacation to Thailand with friends, we decided to explore the lesser-known island of Koh Lanta. One evening, while strolling along the beach, we stumbled upon a gathering of locals and tourists celebrating a traditional Thai festival called Loy Krathong. Intrigued, we joined in the festivities, which included floating candlelit baskets on the water to pay respect to the goddess of water. As the night progressed, we found ourselves immersed in the vibrant atmosphere, surrounded by the glow of lanterns and the sound of traditional music. It was a magical and unexpected experience that allowed us to connect with the local culture in a meaningful way, leaving us with cherished memories of our time in Thailand.
