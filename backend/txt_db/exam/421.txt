Question 
Tell me about a memorable experience you had.

Answer 
Yes, I've had an experience where I lost something important. It was during a trip to Europe when I misplaced my passport. I realized it was missing just as I was about to check in for my flight back home. Panic set in as I frantically searched through my belongings and retraced my steps. Eventually, I remembered leaving it at a cafe I had visited earlier that day. I rushed back to the cafe, and thankfully, they had kept it safe for me. It was a stressful experience, but it taught me the importance of being vigilant with important documents and double checking before leaving any place.
