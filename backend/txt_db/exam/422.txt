Question 
Tell me about a memorable experience you had.

Answer 
During my stay at a hotel in Bangkok, I had a memorable experience when a sudden power outage occurred late at night. The entire hotel was plunged into darkness, leaving guests bewildered and uncertain. However, instead of feeling frustrated, the situation sparked an impromptu gathering in the lobby. Guests from various backgrounds shared stories, snacks, and even played acoustic music by candlelight. It was a unique bonding experience, turning a potential inconvenience into a heartwarming moment of connection. Eventually, the power was restored, but the camaraderie formed during that blackout remained a cherished memory, highlighting the unexpected joys of travel and human connection.
