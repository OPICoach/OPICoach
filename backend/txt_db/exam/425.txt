Question 
Tell me about a memorable experience you had.

Answer 
Yes, I once bought a digital camera online that arrived damaged. Upon opening the package, I noticed a crack on the camera lens, rendering it unusable. Disappointed, I immediately contacted the seller to report the issue and request a replacement or refund. They apologized for the inconvenience and offered to send a replacement camera free of charge. I carefully packaged the damaged camera and shipped it back to the seller. Within a few days, I received the replacement camera in perfect condition. Although the initial experience was frustrating, the seller's prompt response and willingness to rectify the situation restored my confidence in their service.
