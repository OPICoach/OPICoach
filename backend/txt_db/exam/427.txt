Question 
Tell me about a memorable experience you had.

Answer 
Yes, I once left my phone behind at a cafe while meeting a friend for lunch. As we chatted and enjoyed our meal, I absentmindedly placed my phone on the table. After we finished eating, I got up to leave and completely forgot about my phone. It wasn't until I reached home that I realized it was missing. Panicked, I rushed back to the cafe, and thankfully, the staff had found my phone and kept it safe for me. It was a moment of relief and gratitude, but also a lesson learned about the importance of being mindful of my belongings, especially in public places.
