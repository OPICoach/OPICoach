Question 
Tell me about a memorable experience you had.

Answer 
Yes, I once bought a sofa from a furniture store, but upon delivery, I noticed a significant tear in the fabric. It was disappointing, as I had been looking forward to using the sofa in my living room. Immediately, I contacted the store's customer service and explained the issue. They apologized for the inconvenience and offered to either replace the sofa or provide a refund. I opted for a replacement, and they arranged for a new sofa to be delivered at no extra cost. While it was an inconvenience to deal with the problem, the store's prompt resolution and commitment to customer satisfaction ultimately left me satisfied with the outcome.
