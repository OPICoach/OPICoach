Question 
Tell me about a memorable experience you had.

Answer 
Once, after moving to a new city, I had trouble with recycling due to unfamiliarity with the local rules. Accustomed to my previous city's recycling system, I assumed the process would be similar. However, I soon realized that the new city had different guidelines and sorting requirements. Confused, I accidentally put recyclable items in the wrong bins, leading to rejection during pickup. Recognizing my mistake, I reached out to the city's waste management department for guidance. They provided clear instructions and resources to help me understand the correct recycling procedures. With their assistance, I quickly adjusted to the new system and ensured proper recycling practices going forward. This experience taught me the importance of familiarizing oneself with local recycling guidelines when relocating to a new area.
