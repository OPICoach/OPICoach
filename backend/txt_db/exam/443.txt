Question 
Tell me about a memorable experience you had.

Answer 
Once, while hiking with friends in the mountains, we encountered a problem when one of our group members twisted their ankle on a rugged trail. It was a challenging situation as we were miles away from the nearest trailhead and losing daylight fast. With quick thinking, we assessed the injury, provided first aid, and fashioned a makeshift splint using hiking poles and bandages from our first aid kit. We redistributed the weight of our backpacks to ease the injured hiker's load and carefully helped them down the trail at a slower pace. Despite the setback, we remained calm and supportive, encouraging each other along the way. Eventually, we reached a safe stopping point and radioed for assistance, where park rangers arrived promptly to provide further aid and transport. This experience underscored the importance of preparedness, teamwork, and remaining calm in emergencies while hiking.
