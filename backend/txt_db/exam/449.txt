Feedback 
This is a very basic sentence structure using a simple subject ('I') and verb. The lecture indicates that answers starting with a simple 'I' and lacking complexity in subject, object, and modifiers typically result in lower scores (IM1 or below). To achieve higher scores, you need to use more complex sentence structures, varied subjects (e.g., 'What I enjoy'), gerunds, adverbs/phrases (e.g., 'with a sense of peace'), specificifiers (e.g., 'to be more specific'), and infinitives (e.g., 'to kill time'). This simple answer lacks these elements necessary for higher proficiency levels.
