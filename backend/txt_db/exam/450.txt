Tell me about your favorite sport or exercise.

What I enjoy is doing some cardio like swimming on a regular basis as a way to burn extra calories so that I can stay fit and keep in shape.

Feedback 
The instructor explains how to improve OPIc scores by enhancing sentence structure and vocabulary, using exercise as a topic. Starting from a simple sentence like 'I like swimming' (low score due to simple structure and overuse of 'I'), the instructor demonstrates progression. Adding adverbs ('often') improves slightly (IM1). Changing the structure to 'What I enjoy is...' helps avoid starting with 'I' and increases the score (IM2+). Incorporating adverbial phrases like 'on a regular basis' further boosts the score (IM3+). Using better vocabulary such as 'cardio' instead of just 'swimming' or 'exercise' elevates the response (IH). Adding clauses indicating purpose ('to stay fit') or method/result ('as a way to burn extra calories', 'so that I can stay fit and keep in shape') makes the sentence more complex and detailed, characteristic of high-level responses (IH/AL). The key takeaway is that varying sentence structure, using richer vocabulary, and adding complex clauses significantly improve the OPIc score.
