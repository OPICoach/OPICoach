Question 
Clara, is there any difference between the types of clothes people wore in the past and those of today? Please tell me the similarities and differences in detail.

Answer 
Yes, fashion was very different in the past compared to today. In the past, Koreans were very conservative. For example, women were not allowed to wear short skirts. Nowadays, many girls wear short skirts to show their colors. Also, people used to wear baggy pants and hip hop jeans 20 years ago, but not anymore. Hip hop jeans are out of fashion now. Currently, skinny jeans are all the rage. Fashion trends eventually come around.
