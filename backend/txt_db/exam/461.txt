Question 
Clara, what kinds of clothes do you wear in each season?

Answer 
I wear clothes differently according to different seasons. In spring and fall, the weather is mild and clear, so I usually wear light clothes. In summer, I wear shorts and t-shirts because it's scorching hot and I sweat a lot. During winter, I make sure to wear multiple layers of clothes. I also wear long underwear in winter. Otherwise, I could catch a cold. These are the things I wear according to the seasons.

Feedback 
This question asks about what 'you' wear, so use 'I' as the subject. You can use a similar structure to the answer about what 'people' wear, but focus on your personal choices. Describe what you wear in each season: spring/fall (light clothes), summer (shorts, t-shirts, mention sweating), winter (multiple layers, long underwear, mention avoiding catching a cold). Useful expressions include 'I wear differently according to different seasons', 'mild and clear', 'light clothes', 'scorching hot', 'I sweat a lot', 'I'm sweating like a pig' (fancy expression), 'I make sure to wear', 'multiple layers of clothes', 'long underwear', 'otherwise', 'I could catch a cold', 'I try to bundle up' (fancy expression for wearing layers).
