Feedback 
When describing your favorite actor, you can link it to talking about a favorite singer or musician as it involves describing a person. Mention why you like them and specific movies they have 'starred in'. Use phrases like 'I'm a huge fan of' or 'I'm a big fan of'. Describe their acting skills using words like 'incredible' or 'amazing'. Be prepared for potential follow-up questions about issues the actor might have been in the news for. Structure your answer clearly and consider recommending their films.
