Feedback 
For questions about a recent experience like going to the movie theater, you can link it to other stories about recent activities, meeting friends, or going somewhere. Focus not just on the movie itself but also on what you did 'before and after the movie'. Use the phrase 'the last time'. Structure your narrative chronologically and use the intro/conclusion as buffers if needed.
