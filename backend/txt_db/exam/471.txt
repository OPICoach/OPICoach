Question 
Question 10. You indicated in the survey that you like to go hiking. What do you wear when you go hiking? Does it differ according to different seasons?

Answer 
I think I wear differently according to different seasons when I go hiking. It's really cool and mild all day long in spring and fall. So I wear light clothes. But in summer, it's scorching hot and I sweat a lot. So I wear t-shirt and shorts. It's the opposite in winter. It's freezing cold. So I wear multiple layers of clothes and jumper as well.

Feedback 
This question asks about your routine/habit related to hiking attire across seasons. It should be answered in the present tense.  Good fillers like 'I think' can be used. Remember to say 'go hiking', not 'go to hiking'. Describe clothing based on seasons (Spring/Fall: cool/mild, light clothes; Summer: scorching hot, sweat a lot, t-shirt/shorts; Winter: opposite, freezing cold, multiple layers, jumper). Use descriptive adjectives like 'cool and mild', 'scorching hot', 'freezing cold'. Phrases like 'all day long', 'It's the opposite', 'multiple layers of clothes' are useful. You don't necessarily need a concluding sentence.
