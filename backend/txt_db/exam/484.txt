Question 
Tell me about a time when you had a problem with the product you purchased. Did you ever get the wrong product delivered? How did you resolve this issue? Please describe the experience in detail.

Answer 
Well, a problem I've had with the product I purchased? Hmm... I've never had any problem like this, actually. I've never experienced anything like this. Sorry, I can't think of any problem with the product I ordered. I'm afraid I should move on to the next question. I'll try my best to answer your next question.

Feedback 
This response also employs strategies from the lecture for difficult questions. Rephrasing ('a problem I've had with the product I purchased?') confirms understanding. Phrases like 'I've never had any problem like this' and 'I can't think of any problem with the product I ordered' directly state the inability to recall or having the experience. Using 'I'm afraid I should move on to the next question' is a polite way to indicate the need to skip, and promising to do better on the next question ('I'll try my best to answer your next question') shows willingness, as advised by the lecturer. These phrases are presented as useful tools for managing unexpected problem/experience questions. The lecturer also suggests practicing phrases like 'A time when I got the wrong product delivered?' to rephrase the question.
