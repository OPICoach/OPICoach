Question 
I'm going to give you a situation to act out. You just moved into a new apartment and you want to do recycling but do not know the rules for this apartment. Ask three to four questions to a person working at an administration office of this apartment about recycling system.

Answer 
Suggested answer includes starting with an introduction and purpose (Hi, I'm a new tenant, I have some questions about recycling), asking simple questions using 6 Ws (Where is the recycling site? When is the collection day? Do I get fine if I don't do it right?), using filler phrases and pretending to hear answers (Oh really? I see. Oh, one more thing.), and ending with a thank you (Thank you so much for your kind explanation. Bye.).

Feedback 
Instructor's feedback emphasizes using simple questions, starting and ending politely to extend the conversation, using filler phrases like 'I have some questions about' and 'Oh one more thing' as versatile expressions, performing a 'one-man show' by reacting as if the other person answered without actually answering yourself, and understanding question intonation (rising for Yes/No questions, falling for others).
