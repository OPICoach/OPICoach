Question 
I'm so sorry but there is a situation I need you to resolve. You had many parties and threw out a lot of garbage. Your neighbors are complaining about your garbage, so give two or three solutions to solve the problem.

Answer 
Suggested answer includes starting with an apology (I am so sorry about the problem), explaining the situation (I had too many parties and couldn't control garbage amount), offering solutions (First, I will have fewer parties. Another option I can think of is I'll have parties outside.), using transition phrases (I came up with some solutions.), and ending by asking for preference and offering compensation (Which option do you prefer? Do you have another option in mind? To make it up to you, I want to buy you dinner.).

Feedback 
Instructor's feedback highlights that the topic remains the same as Stage 1, the importance of acknowledging the problem and apologizing, offering 2-3 clear solutions, using versatile phrases like 'I came up with some solutions/options', 'Another option I can think of is', 'Which option do you prefer?', 'Do you have another option in mind?', and 'To make it up to you', and prioritizing natural delivery and fluency over perfect grammar.
