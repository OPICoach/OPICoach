Question 
What's your favorite dish to prepare? Why do you like making the dish?

Answer 
It is so obvious. Cooking is tough. Just between you and me, I'm a good cook. Preparing dinner for my family makes me feel excited. My favorite dish is curry rice. because it does not take a long time to make it. To cook it, I have to steam the vegetables and grill the meat. Then I add the curry powder. That's it. It tastes heavenly. Goes well with kimchi.

Feedback 
This answer demonstrates characteristics of an AL level response. Compared to an IH level answer which uses many short, simple sentences (e.g., "I like cooking. I cook instant noodle. It is delicious."), this answer uses varied sentence structures, including non-subject pronouns and gerund subjects ("Cooking is tough", "Preparing dinner... makes me feel excited", "It does not take..."). It incorporates specific vocabulary ("steam", "grill", "curry powder") and colloquial/idiomatic expressions ("It is so obvious", "Just between you and me", "That's it", "It tastes heavenly", "Goes well with"). The use of patterns like "makes me feel excited" and "goes well with" is highlighted as beneficial for applying to other topics. Practicing with proper intonation and stress (especially on adjectives, nouns, and verbs) is crucial for delivery.
