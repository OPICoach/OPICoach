Question 
Sometimes unexpected things happen while cooking. What kind of food were you cooking? What was the problem?

Answer 
I remember the time when I cook traditional dishes to my friends. About a month ago. It was my birthday. I invited all of my friends. Because they are party goers. Nobody can take away my desire to cook. Then I cooked bulgogi. But it was too sweet. It was impossible to eat this. Without hesitation. I decided to get chicken delivered. As you know. Chicken never fails to make people happy. To wrap it up. That was my memorable experience.

This answer effectively addresses the question about a past cooking experience, demonstrating the importance of using the past tense consistently. It includes introductory and concluding phrases ("I remember the time when", "About a month ago", "As you know", "To wrap it up"). It uses specific vocabulary and expressions ("traditional dishes", "party goers", "take away my desire", "Without hesitation", "get chicken delivered", "never fails to make people happy"). The pattern "Nobody can take away my desire to..." and "never fails to make people happy" are noted as useful for other topics. Consistent use of past tense verbs is essential for experience questions. Practicing with intonation and stress is also emphasized for a natural delivery.
