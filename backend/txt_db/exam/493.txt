Question 
What's your favorite dish to prepare? Why do you like making the dish?

Answer 
It is so obvious. Cooking is tough. Just between you and me, I'm a good cook. Preparing dinner for my family makes me feel excited. My favorite dish is curry rice. Because it does not take a long time to make it. To cook it, I have to steam the vegetables and grill the meat. Then I add the curry powder. That's it. It tastes heavenly. Goes well with 김치.
