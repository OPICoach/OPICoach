Question 
Sometimes unexpected things happen while cooking. What kind of food were you cooking? What was the problem?

Answer 
I remember the time when I cook traditional dishes to my friends. About a month ago. It was my birthday. I invited all of my friends. Because they are party goers. Nobody can take away my desire to cook. Then I cooked 불고기. But it was too sweet. It was impossible to eat this. Without hesitation. I decided to get chicken delivered. As you know, Chicken never fails to make people happy. To wrap it up. That was my memorable experience.

Feedback 
This answer is typical for AL level. It uses past tense consistently for the narrative ('was', 'invited', 'cooked', 'was impossible', 'decided'). It includes specific time markers ('About a month ago') and sets the scene ('It was my birthday'). It uses transition words and phrases ('I remember the time when...', 'Then', 'Without hesitation', 'As you know', 'To wrap it up'). It incorporates advanced vocabulary and expressions ('party goers', 'Nobody can take away my desire to...', 'Without hesitation', 'get chicken delivered', 'never fails to make people happy'). The structure and detail are strong.
