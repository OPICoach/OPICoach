Question 
What do you do for a living? Describe your typical work day in detail.

Answer 
Hi, I'm an office worker. I work at Google as a manager. I normally go to work at 7 AM. I leave the company before 6 PM.

Feedback 
This answer is too simple and lacks detail. All sentences are short and start with 'I', making the response sound choppy and repetitive. It just states basic facts without describing the typical workday 'in detail' as requested. To get a higher score, you need to use more complex sentences, vary sentence structure, and provide specific examples of your daily tasks and responsibilities.
