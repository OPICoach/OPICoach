Question 
Tell me about the cafe you go to most often. Where is it? What does it look like? Why do you like the place?

Answer 
It's time to talk about my favorite cafe. Hey, just between you and me, this cafe is a hidden gem in my community. I call the cafe the nest. It is located near my place. It takes only 10 minutes to get there. The cafe has a perfect location. When it comes to furniture, there are so many comfortable sofas, chairs, and tables. The background music amazes me a lot. They offer a wide range of coffee and food. For example, the cheesecake goes great with americano. No cap. We really hit it off. To sum up, the cafe always makes me so happy.

Feedback 
This AL-level answer uses a strong introduction ('It's time to talk about...'). It includes specific details like calling the cafe a 'hidden gem' and giving it a nickname ('the nest'). Phrases like 'When it comes to' are good transitions. Using non-living subjects like 'The background music amazes me' and 'the cafe always makes me so happy' is a key feature of higher-level answers. It uses varied vocabulary ('wide range of') and colloquial expressions/idioms ('goes great with', 'No cap', 'hit it off'). The conclusion 'To sum up' provides a good wrap-up. Practice reading aloud to make these phrases sound natural.
