Question 
You indicated that you like to cook. What do you like to cook the most? Why do you like cooking that meal? How do you make it? How does it taste? Give me all the details.

Answer 
I like to cook Samgyetang. It is a Korean chicken soup. I like it because it is very delicious and healthy. To make it, I use a whole chicken and put rice and ginseng inside. Then I boil it for about one hour. It tastes very good.

Feedback 
Your answer is a good start! You clearly stated what you like to cook (Samgyetang) and touched upon why, how, and the taste. To get a higher score, try adding more detail and using more varied vocabulary and sentence structures. For example, instead of just 'Korean chicken soup,' you could say 'traditional Korean food.' For 'healthy,' consider 'It's full of nutrients.' When explaining how to make it, use transition words like 'First,' and specific verbs like 'stuff the chicken with sticky rice and ginseng' and 'put in jujubes and garlic.' Mentioning how to season it ('season it with salt and pepper') and what to eat it with ('eat the chicken with kimchi') adds great detail. Practice linking your ideas smoothly, like 'I like this dish because it's delicious and it's full of nutrients.' Keep practicing the specific phrases from the lesson like 'My favorite dish to prepare is...' and 'What's so special about this dish is that we cook a whole chicken without cutting it up.'
