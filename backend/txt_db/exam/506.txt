Let me tell you about what I do to stay healthy. (Missing 'to' after 'do') To stay healthy, I do a lot of things. (Good start) First of all, I go jogging almost every day. (Good transition) I usually jog for about an hour. (Pause 'um' here, try to avoid. Add location like 'at the park' for detail) I think it is the best way to maintain health. (Pause after 'think', try to connect. Add example why it's the best, e.g., 'I've become healthier since I started') And also, I try to be a morning person. (Speak faster, avoid 'uh'. Practice with 'a' - 'a morning person') I go to bed earlier and get up earlier. (Verb 'go to bed' is correct for 'sleep'. Add specific times like 'around 10' or 'before 7'. Add importance of sleep like 'get enough sleep') Plus, I take healthy supplements like vitamin and protein. (Pause 'um' here, use 'actually'. 'supplements' is plural. 'vitamin' should be 'multivitamins' or 'vitamins'. Pronunciation 'suppliment' instead of 'supplement') And I also drink tons of water. (Flat intonation. 'tons of water' is exaggeration, add specific amount like '2 liters' or '7 to 10 cups'. Add reason like 'to stay hydrated') That's all about me. (This phrase is for self-introduction. Use 'That's all I do for my health' or 'That's all I do to stay healthy')
