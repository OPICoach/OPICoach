Question 
Describe the home you lived in as a child. How was that home different from the home you live in now?

Answer 
My childhood is home. ì•„, actually I can't remember very specifically, but one thing I just remember very clearly it was so huge house. Sofa, furnitures, chairs, desks, everything was so huge, so big. It feels like I was a ant. Because I think I was a little girl, that's why I feels like it. Now I'm living more big house, but I'm still need more place. I feels it's not bigger than when I kid is. Oh, maybe I'm growing, so that's why I feels like it.

This student needs to practice the comparison strategy more. Also, for Rule Number 5, they need to consistently follow Rule Number 7. Avoid making honest excuses right at the beginning of your answer. Let's look at the grammar: 'My childhood is home' - Good start, showing engagement with the question. 'actually I can't remember very specifically, but one thing I just remember very clearly it was so huge house.' - This is an example of starting with an excuse (Rule 7). Better: 'I can't remember very specifically, but one thing I do remember is that it was clearly a huge house.' 'Sofa, furnitures, chairs, desks, everything was so huge, so big.' - Good focus on the 'huge house' theme (Rule 5). Grammar fix: 'The sofa, furniture, chairs, desk, everything was just so huge, so big.' 'It feels like I was a ant.' - Good use of a simile. Grammar fix: 'I truly felt like an ant.' 'Because I think I was a little girl, that's why I feels like it.' - Good use of 'I think' and 'that's why'. Grammar fix: 'Cause I think I was a little girl, that's why I felt like everything was so big.' 'Now I'm living more big house, but I'm still need more place.' - Grammar fix: 'Now I'm living in an even bigger home, but I still feel like I need more space.' Use 'even' to show surprise, or just 'bigger'. 'place' should be 'space'. 'I feels it's not bigger than when I kid is.' - Grammar fix: 'I feel like it's not that big.' or 'I feel like it's similar to when I was a kid.' Avoid comparing back to the past here in the present section. 'Oh, maybe I'm growing, so that's why I feels like it.' - This explanation is a bit difficult. Grammar fix: 'Oh, maybe I'm growing, so that's why I feel like it.' or 'Oh, maybe I'm growing, so my perspective is changing.' (More advanced). The comparison strategy should be: Main Point (Pure Present) -> Past (Focus on Main Point) -> Present (Expand on Main Point) -> Conclusion. This answer went: Past -> Present -> Conclusion, which is okay but less structured for comparison.
