Question 
Tell me about a memorable past experience you had.

Answer 
Well, I remember a time when I felt really bad. I actually didn't leave my house for about three days. The first time I left was to meet a friend for lunch. And when I walked in, she was already at the table and I sat down and she said, "God, you look like hell." I said thanks, um, I feel really, um, I'm not functioning. Later, I said, "Let me ask you something. Do you remember when we were in college and really wild and kind of dumb?" She said, "Yeah." And I said, "Remember when we'd leave a really bad message on our ex-boyfriend's answering machine? Then we'd have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape?" And she goes, "Uh, no." Also, I can give you another example. Three months ago I was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shinguards and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store.

Your answer effectively uses past tense verbs (didn't leave, left, was, walked in, sat down, said, were) to describe a past experience. Good use of direct quotes ("God, you look like hell") makes the story vivid. Phrases like "I'm not functioning" are useful for expressing feeling unwell or unable to cope. The structure "Let me ask you something" and "Do you remember when...?" are great for incorporating dialogue and shared memories. You correctly used 'would leave' and 'would have to' to describe habitual past actions. Vocabulary like 'really wild and kind of dumb', 'break into', 'erase the tape', 'sporting goods store', 'goggles', and 'shinguards' adds specific detail. Note the pronunciation of 'leave' (long 'e') and 'sat'/'said' (both sound like 'sat'). Using 'she goes' is a natural, informal way to report what someone said. Describing simultaneous actions with '-ing' (e.g., 'I was in a store buying...') is also well-used.
