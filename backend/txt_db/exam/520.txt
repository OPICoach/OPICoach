Question 
You moved into a new house and you do not know about the recycling system. Ask three or four questions to the administration office about the recycling system.

Answer 
Hi, I'm new here. And have some questions about recycling system. Where is the recycling site? When is the recycling day? Do I get a fine if I don't do it right? Oh one more thing. Could you help me to recycling? This is my first time recycling, so I'm worried that I could make some mistakes. Thank you so much for your kind answers. Bye.

Feedback 
For role-play questions, focus on using 5W1H questions. Pay attention to intonation (raise for yes/no questions, lower for wh-questions). Practice the one-man show where you act as if the other person is responding. Phrases like 'Oh one more thing' are helpful transitions. 'Get a fine' is correct, 'get find' is also acceptable. Explaining why you need help (e.g., 'This is my first time...') is optional but good. Emphasize 'so' in 'Thank you so much'.
