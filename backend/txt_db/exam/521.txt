Question 
You moved into a new house, had too many parties, and took too much garbage out. Your neighbors are complaining about it. Please talk to your neighbors and give two solutions to solve the problem.

Answer 
Hi, I am so sorry about what happened. And I can think of several options. One is I will have parties outside. (Optional: I'm a party animal, so I cannot give up on having parties.) If not, I will use catering service to solve the problem. Which option do you prefer? Do you have another option in mind? Oh, and to make it up to you, I want to buy you lunch this Sunday. Once again, I am so sorry. Okay, bye.

Feedback 
Recognize the need to apologize first ('I am so sorry about what happened'). Use the versatile phrase 'I can think of several options' for suggesting solutions. Present solutions clearly ('One is...', 'If not...'). Use versatile phrases for asking for preference or other ideas ('Which option do you prefer?', 'Do you have another option in mind?'). The phrase 'To make it up to you, I want to buy you lunch' is useful for apologizing in a neighborly context ('To make it up to you' means 'because I'm sorry' or 'to compensate'). Emphasize 'so' in 'I am so sorry'.
