Question 
Have you ever had a similar experience (e.g., neighbor problems)? (Typical follow-up question for the previous scenario)

Answer 
Yes, [describe experience] or I'm so sorry but I don't have that experience. I will answer more in my next question.

Feedback 
For this type of follow-up question (3단계), you can either share a relevant experience (free talking) or state that you don't have the experience and move on. It is acceptable to skip a couple of questions this way if you answer others well, but do not do it for every question.
