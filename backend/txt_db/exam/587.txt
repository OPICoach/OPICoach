Question 
캐나다 말투랑 미국 말투랑 다른가요?

Answer 
약간 달라요. 아 미국 애들은 약간 많이 they like to their tongue So whenever they speak English you know they speak like this you know what I mean like you know they like rolling their tongue you know what I'm saying? They really love to do that you know they like to talk like this you know what I'm saying what's up man how are you doing you know man like that's how they talk and it's just like what are they saying? Now as an English speaker I can understand 그런 건 다 알아듣죠 근데 한국 사람한테는 많이 어쩔 때는 뭘 알아들을 수 있어요 왜냐하면 거기는 second가 잖아요 사람들을 엄청 많이 빨리 말하잖아요 그것 때문에 그렇습니다 근데 캐나다 애들은 좀 더 정확하게 말하는 느낌입니다 아무튼 여러분들이 이제 영어를 배우고 싶다 한테 배우세요 그거는 저 추천입니다 아무튼

Explains that American and Canadian accents differ slightly. Describes American English as having more 'rolling' of the tongue and being spoken faster, which can be difficult for Korean learners. Characterizes Canadian English as sounding more precise.
