Question 
It's a test level question what? 오케이 I got four times seriously so what do you think about the test level 6655 오케이 I heard if you want some I heard if you want you should choose something that's more difficult

Answer 
Yes 여기에서 좀 내가 이미 대답을 했죠 아무튼 if you want Well is the best 아 근데 많이 학생들이 나중에 그 두 번째가 좀 어렵다고 많이 들었어요. 그러니까 저의 추천은 65입니다. For most students 오케이 so that's what I want to say Alright

Feedback 
Reiterates that higher levels offer a better chance for AL/IH. Suggests 6-5 as the recommendation for most students aiming for AL, noting that the second question set at 6-6 can be challenging.
