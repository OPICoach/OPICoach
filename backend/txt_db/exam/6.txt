Question 
Step 6: Ask your third question.

Answer 
But you know, uh I like listen to music, so I really need um um iPhone with speaker, so do you have uh very nice speaker for my iPhone?

Feedback 
Very nice filler combination 'But you know'. Grammar correction: 'I like to listen to music, so I really need good quality speakers in my phone. So does the iPhone 10 come with nice speakers?'. 'my iPhone' is a mistake as she hasn't bought it yet. Suggests adding a phrase like 'Oh, I almost forgot' before the last question for a more natural flow.
