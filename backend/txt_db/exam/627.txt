The teacher explained that this is a Past Experience / Problem Solution type question (Roleplay 13). Key points for answering include: 1. Understanding the nuance between 'problem' and 'issue' (issue generally bigger). 2. Using 'weather' as a versatile topic to combine with others, providing vocabulary like 'humid', 'sticky', 'muggy', 'scorching hot', 'sweltering', 'freezing', 'blistering cold', 'wind chill', 'humidex', and intensity words like 'stupid', 'crazy'. 3. Using 'money' related vocabulary and expressions is crucial (e.g., 'well off', 'made a huge dent in my wallet', 'bank on it', 'made bank', 'pull the trigger', 'broke', 'car poor', 'house poor', 'mortgage'). 4. When the question offers options (e.g., bad weather OR unexpected problem), it's best to choose one of the provided options (A or B) rather than introducing a new one. 5. Structure the main point using What, Feeling, Why or What, Why, Feeling, and practice both orders to find what works best. 6. Emphasize the importance of using pronouns (it, there, he, she, them, they, their) to make answers sound more sophisticated and less simple, giving examples with a restaurant and a borrowed camera.
