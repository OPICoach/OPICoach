Question 
Tell me about something that you have heard or read about recycling in the news. What was it about? Give me all the details about that issue on recycling.

Answer 
Oh my gosh. I have to say this is a really difficult question. Well honestly, I have no idea about this topic. I mean I haven't thought about it. This is something I've never thought about. You know, I hardly watch the news these days and I haven't watched any news related to recycling. Seriously, I haven't. So I can't think of any issues related to recycling but I know that recycling is mandatory in Korea. Yeah, basically I would say recycling is very well practiced everywhere in Korea. I guess that's all I can say about this topic. I'm gonna have to say recycling is people's daily lives in Korea. Well, that's pretty much it. Thank you.

Feedback 
This answer effectively handles a difficult, unexpected question (돌발 유형) by acknowledging the difficulty upfront using natural filler phrases like "Oh my gosh" and "I have to say". It honestly states a lack of specific knowledge about recycling issues in the news ("I have no idea about this topic," "I haven't thought about it," "I hardly watch the news"). Crucially, it pivots smoothly to a related, general topic the speaker *can* talk about (the state of recycling in Korea), demonstrating fluency and topic maintenance even when unable to answer the specific prompt directly. Key vocabulary like "mandatory" and "very well practiced" is used effectively. The answer concludes clearly, indicating the end of the response. This strategy of acknowledging difficulty, stating lack of specific knowledge, and pivoting to a related topic is a strong approach for high-difficulty 돌발 questions where you might not have specific information.
