Question 
Tell me about the geographic features of your country. What makes them different from other countries? Are there many mountains or beaches? Describe the geography of your country in details.

Answer 
Oh wow, the geographical features of my country? Oh my goodness, this is an extremely difficult question. Honestly, I haven't thought about it at all. Well um, I'm not quite sure about this topic but I'll try my best to describe it. Alright, so I was born and raised in South Korea which is located in East Asia. First of all, as you may know, Korea is a peninsula. I would say Korea is a small but beautiful country with diverse landscapes. Basically, Korea is almost completely surrounded by water. The sea surrounds the country on three sides. So Korea has a number of beautiful islands, beaches, rivers, lakes, mountains, you name it. Speaking of my country, um I'd like to tell you about one of the most beautiful places in Korea. Have you heard of Jeju Island? Jeju Island is the largest island in Korea which is located southwest of the Korean peninsula. It's the volcanic island with lots of mountains and waterfalls. I'd have to say I'm so grateful that I live in such a beautiful country. So if you haven't been to Korea Eva, I'd like to recommend visiting Korea someday. You love it here.

Feedback 
The lecturer provides a sample answer for describing the geography of Korea, targeting IH to AL levels. The answer is structured into an introduction, two body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The introduction uses fillers like 'Oh wow', 'Oh my goodness', 'Honestly', and 'Well um' to acknowledge the difficulty of the topic and buy time, stating 'this is an extremely difficult question' and 'I haven't thought about it at all'. It ends with a commitment to try: 'I'll try my best to describe it'. Body 1 introduces Korea as a 'peninsula' located in 'East Asia'. It describes Korea as 'a small but beautiful country with diverse landscapes'. Key geographical features are listed using 'a number of' and the phrase 'you name it' (islands, beaches, rivers, lakes, mountains). It also mentions that Korea is 'almost completely surrounded by water' and 'the sea surrounds the country on three sides'. Body 2 provides a specific example, 'Jeju Island', introduced with the connector 'Speaking of my country'. It describes Jeju as 'one of the most beautiful places', 'the largest island in Korea', located 'southwest of the Korean peninsula', and a 'volcanic island with lots of mountains and waterfalls'. The conclusion expresses gratitude for living in 'such a beautiful country' using 'I'd have to say I'm so grateful that I live in...'. It ends by recommending Eva visit Korea using 'I'd like to recommend visiting Korea someday' and expressing confidence she would like it: 'You love it here'. The feedback emphasizes using diverse vocabulary (e.g., 'extremely difficult', 'diverse landscapes', 'a number of', 'you name it', 'volcanic island', 'so grateful', 'such a beautiful country', 'recommend visiting'), grammatical structures (e.g., 'haven't thought', 'was born and raised', 'which is located', 'as you may know', 'I would say', 'surrounded by', 'has a number of', 'Speaking of + noun', 'Have you heard of', 'I'd like to tell you about', 'I'd have to say I'm so grateful that'), and natural-sounding fillers and connectors to make the answer sound spontaneous and conversational, suitable for higher OPIc levels. Pronunciation tips are given for words like 'peninsula', 'basically', 'you name it', and phrases like 'I'll have to say'.
