Question 
You indicated in the survey that you enjoy cycling. Compare the bike you have right now with the one you had when you were young. How are they different? Tell me about it in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
Well, the bike I have right now is very different from my old bike. To start with, I used to have a $10 bike when I was young. So when I was young, I got it as a birthday gift from my parents. And since I was very young, it had training wheels. It was very small and it broke easily. My current bike, it's a lot different from the old one. Today, I ride a mountain bike. I had to work five months to pay $500 for this bike. It was way too expensive. But I fell in love with its design at first sight. So I had no option. Of course, it doesn't have training wheels as I'm a grown up. And there are many attachments such as lights for night riding and a water bottle holder. Oh and has a strong body and never goes wrong. It's my all time favorite item and I adore it with all my heart.
