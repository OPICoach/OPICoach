Question 
How has the process of recycling changed from the past? Please tell me in detail.

Answer 
Yes 에바. There have been a lot of changes in recycling. As far as I know, the biggest difference is what people think of recycling. I mean, in the past, people didn't really care much about recycling. They just threw garbage away anywhere at any time they wanted to. However, people have changed. Many people have developed an interest in recycling and try to live in a green way. What's more, the recycling system was not as strict as it is now. The rules for recycling are now much more complicated than in the past. As far as I can remember, people didn't have to pay fines for not recycling. But these days, we have set days for recycling and specific sites to throw recyclable away. If you fail to recycle properly, you have to pay a fine. Oh and there are many more recycling sites. You can easily find one on every corner of apartment complexes. I personally think these are the biggest changes in recycling.

Feedback 
This is a difficult '돌발' (unexpected) topic, specifically a past vs present comparison about recycling. The key is to identify it as a past vs present comparison and focus on that. Use fillers like 'Yes 에바.' or 'I mean,'. Useful patterns include: 'There have been a lot of changes in A', 'as far as I know', 'as far as I can remember', 'the biggest difference is...', 'didn't really care much about', 'threw A away', 'anywhere at any time they wanted to', 'developed an interest in', 'live in a green way', 'What's more,', 'not as strict as it is now', 'much more complicated than in the past', 'pay fines', 'set days for recycling', 'specific sites', 'fail to recycle properly', 'pay a fine', 'every corner of apartment complexes', 'I personally think these are the biggest changes in A'. Focus on clear communication and using correct tenses. It's helpful to map out your ideas in Korean first.
