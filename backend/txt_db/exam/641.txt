Question 
How has the relationship between your country and neighboring countries changed? What is the reason for that change?

Answer 
Um, this is a difficult question. I haven't thought about this, but I will try my best to answer. I'd like to talk about the relationship between Korea and China. There have been a lot of changes in the relationship between the two countries. For example, in the past, there was not much interaction between the two countries. Thus, there were not many Chinese tourist in Korea. Oh and as far as I know, Korean music was not popular in China. But nowadays, Korean pop songs and singers are all the rage. As a result, there is more interaction between the two countries. I mean, many Chinese people are visiting Korea and the tourism industry is getting bigger day by day. I personally think that this is the biggest change between Korea and China.

Feedback 
This is a very difficult question combining a '사회 이슈' (social issue) topic with a past vs present comparison. Acknowledge the difficulty using phrases like 'Um, this is a difficult question. I haven't thought about this, but I will try my best to answer.' Choose one specific neighboring country to focus on (e.g., China). Select an easy, relatable topic for the change, like the influence of K-pop on tourism and interaction, rather than complex historical or political issues. Useful patterns include: 'I'd like to talk about...', 'There have been a lot of changes in A', 'in the past', 'there was not much interaction', 'Thus,', 'as far as I know', 'But nowadays,', 'all the rage' (or 'the trend'), 'As a result,', 'there is more interaction', 'I mean,', 'visiting Korea', 'tourism industry is getting bigger day by day', 'I personally think that this is the biggest change between A and B'. Focus on clear communication and using correct tenses. Pre-mapping ideas is highly recommended for difficult topics like this.
