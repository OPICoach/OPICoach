Question 
Is there a particular restaurant you often go to? What kind of food does it serve? Why do you like to go there?

Answer 
I often go to Haoma, a Chinese restaurant near my place. They serve many different types of food, such as noodles, dumplings, and fried rice. My favorite dish to get there is the sweet and sour pork. I like this restaurant because the prices are reasonable. Also, the food is really good. Sometimes they give customers free appetizers.

Feedback 
This question asks about a specific restaurant you frequent, the food it serves, and your reasons for liking it. It's a place description question, which is very common. When describing a place, always include your preferences and reasons. The appropriate tense is the present tense. You can choose a Korean restaurant and strategically link it to the 'cooking' survey topic. For the answer structure, you can mention the restaurant name and location (e.g., 'a Korean restaurant near my house' - applicable to other places like banks or parks). Describe the food they serve (e.g., 'Korean traditional food, such as Doenjang jjigae and fried chicken'). Mention what the restaurant is known for (using 'be known for') and other reasons you like it (e.g., 'staff members are very kind', 'it opens 24/7'). Specify your favorite dish to order (linking to cooking, e.g., 'My favorite dish to order is Doenjang jjigae'). Explain why you like that dish (e.g., 'because it's tasty and it's full of nutrients'). Conclude with a forward-looking statement (e.g., 'I want to go there again sometime this week'). Useful expressions include 'It's full of nutrients' and 'sometime this week'.
