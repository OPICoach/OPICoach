Question 
Tell me about where you live. What does it look like and how many rooms does it have? Also, tell me about the things you do at home, or during your vacation at home.

Answer 
Okay, well, you know what? This is a great question. Because I'm such a homebody. Um I'm not an introvert but I just love to be home. So, let me tell you about where I live. I live alone in a small apartment in downtown Seoul. Actually, it's a studio apartment. So there's no separate bedroom. basically everything is combined into a single room. But I can say I've got everything I need. And my apartment is very cozy and comfortable. When I stay at home, I don't do anything too active. I like to just relax and watch movies chilling in my bed. Honestly, I get kind of lazy. Yeah, like I said, I'm a homebody. Well, sometimes Like during vacations I invite friends or family. we hang out and get some food delivered. So overall I can say my home is the best place to spend my vacation. Honestly though, I don't feel like going out. because of the COVID-19 pandemic. I would call my home a safe haven.

Feedback 
This is a sample answer provided by the lecturer, not a student's answer. The feedback is based on the lecturer's tips for building this answer. Structure: Start with an intro (homebody), describe your home (size, type, features, feeling), describe activities at home (relaxing, watching movies, inviting people, eating), and conclude (why home is good for vacation, current context like COVID-19). Use fillers (Okay, well, you know what, Um, Honestly, Well, sometimes, Yeah, like I said, So overall, Honestly though) to sound natural. Use varied vocabulary and phrases (homebody, introvert, studio apartment, cozy, comfortable, relax, chill, get kind of lazy, invite friends or family, hang out, get food delivered, best place to spend my vacation, feel like ing, COVID-19 pandemic, safe haven). Practice grammar like comma + ing (chilling in my bed). For AL, add more detail or slightly more advanced expressions (I've got everything I need, safe haven, Honestly though). Practice pronunciation (Seoul, overall, chill) and vary your speed and intonation to sound genuine.
