Going to the park and doing activities there can be used as an answer for maintaining health.

Feedback 
Connect the concept of 'going to the park' and 'activities done there' to 'health' and 'staying healthy'. Use the activity vocabulary from the park activities section (walking, jogging, exercising, working out, getting fresh air) to explain how going to the park contributes to health. You can also mention that people in your country go to parks for health.
