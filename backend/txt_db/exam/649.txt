Question 
What kind of activities do people in your country do in their free time? How do they spend time with friends or family? What are the activities they do and why do they like to do those activities?

Going to the park and doing activities there can be used as an answer for free time activities.

Feedback 
Connect 'park activities' to 'free time' and 'leisure'. Use the activity vocabulary from the park activities section (walking, jogging, exercising, picnicking, enjoying nature, taking photos) and mention doing these activities with friends or family. Explain why these activities are enjoyable (e.g., getting fresh air, enjoying the scenery).
