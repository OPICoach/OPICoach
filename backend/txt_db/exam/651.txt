Feedback 
Okay, so I will help you uh over there. And Hand, you did a good job. Let me give you the feedback now, okay? Thanks. Okay, thank you so much. Take care. 핸드 씨가 이렇게 대답을 했습니다. I have a terrible I have a terrible story about that. And you know, when I was a child. 일단은 시작을 너무 좋았어요. Right? I have a terrible experience. Okay, I have a terrible experience about whatever you're asking, okay? I have a terrible experience related to a car accident. 막 추가로 더 할 수 있어요. 이렇게 right? Related to a car accident. Related to what you're asking. Okay? 이런 것도 너무 좋습니다. 아무튼 related to 이게 좋은 expression이니까 여러분들은 가끔씩 이렇게 써 보세요. 생각보다 되게 부드러워요. 좀 general 하잖아요. 근데 what you're asking. 이미 물어봤으니까 굳이 뭐 car accident 보다는 그냥 뭐 what you're asking 하는 게 좀 이렇게 부드러운 느낌이 나는 나긴 하네요. Right? So I have a terrible experience related to what you're asking. Ooh, not bad. Let's keep going here. My mom took me to school. 여러분들이 대답할 때 다른 사람에게 얘기하면은 갑자기 그 대답 quality가 올라갑니다. So my mom was taking me to school, very nice. Yeah, by her car. But my mom was taking me to school by her car. 학생들이 많이 이런 약간 실수를 하긴 합니다. By her car. 자, 이게 좀 뻣뻣해요. 문법으로는 괜찮지만 근데 조금 더 부드럽게 하려면은 by her car 아예 빼고 my mom was taking 보다는 다른 단어가 그냥 훨씬 더 깔끔합니다. 이게 어떤 단어입니까? 어떤 단어일까요? 여기서만 이 단어만 change 하면은 by her car 필요가 없습니다. Carrying는 이거입니다. 뭐 업어 준다. 그런 거죠. 네. Driving is the answer here. Okay? Now, taking me to school is also good. 맞아요. 근데 taking me가 이제 약간 여러 가지 의미가 있긴 있죠. Alright? 근데 driving은 100% 운전이다. 차 운전, 자동차 운전. Okay? So my mom was driving me to school 너무 깔끔해요. 이렇게 할 수 있으면은. All of a sudden, uh, when when when I was go went to my my school. 음. 어, when I went to my school. 그거는 이제 이미 school에 갔어요. 그러니까 여러 가지 의미가 있긴 있어요. Right? 내가 그 학교를 갔었을 때 막 이런 느낌이거든요. 그러니까 이거 보다는 어떻게 해야 됩니까? 가는 중이었어요. 그 말을 하고 싶은 거 같아요. 핸드 님이. On another 단어, another 단어. To school. 이렇게. On my way exactly. I wanted my way. Okay. Wow, that was totally off there, okay? Uh, on my way to school. Exactly. Let's keep going. Some cars hit and crushed my mother's car. Some car. 여기서 이제 조금 더 그 감정 추가할 수 있습니다. Right? Some crazy dude crashed into us. Okay? My mother's car 보다는 우리한테 crash 했다. 이런 느낌이죠. Okay? So on my way to school, some crazy dude crashed into us. 여기 조금 더 specific 하려면은 만약에 뒤 부분에 crash 했다. 그 rear ended us. Okay? 옆에 했다. T-boned us. Okay? T-bone 스테이크 말고. Okay? 약간 배고프죠. Okay? T-boned us는 여기 옆에 이렇게 T로 이렇게 되는 거예요. T. T-boned us. Okay? Or 앞부분. Just head on. Crashed into us head on. 이런 식. 그러니까 여기는 조금 더 specific 한 거예요. Let's keep going here. Yeah, it's it's very terrible, yeah, and scared. Okay, so it was terrible. Very nice. It was scared. 자, 이게죠. 틀렸죠. 이거 어떻게 고쳐야 됩니까? Yes, it was scary. It was so scary. 맞아요. 너무 무서웠다. 그러면 우리가 그거 느끼는 거죠. 자동차가 그거 안 느낍니다. Unless you have some 자동차 from the future. Alright? I don't know. Let's keep going. Because that road is so fast and so yeah, my my mother's car. Okay, so that road was so fast. 음. 길거리가 빨랐다. 약간 어색하죠. So it 그냥 it was the highway 하면 됩니다. Highway는 그 빨라 빨리 가는 곳. 막 100km 가야 되는 곳. 그게 highway예요. So you know, we were on the highway. Cars were going so fast. Cars were going so fast 하면서 and we were frightened. Okay? So we were scared, we were frightened. Alright? 여기 이제 좀 되게 고급 natural 한 약간 slang 쪽으로 가려면은 we nearly 오줌 쌌다. Pissed our pants. 너무 natural 한 좋은 expression입니다. We nearly pissed our pants. 엄청 대박 무서워 가지고 오줌 쌀 뻔 했다. 이런 느낌이에요. Okay? Pissed off는 다른 의미죠. Pissed off는 화났다. Okay? We nearly pooed our pants. 약간 그 똑같은 의미예요. 근데 pissed our pants가 좀 더 많이 쓰는 표현입니다. Poo 하려면은 이런 식으로 해야 됩니다. We nearly shat ourselves. 근데 어렵죠. Shat. Shat는 slang이에요. Shit 하고 똑같습니다. 어, stopped in the on the road. And you know, uh surround my mother's car and all cars uh drive so fast. Okay, so 여기서 이야기 약간 조절하려면은 we were right in the middle of the highway. 이렇게. Cars were you know, passing by so fast. 이런 느낌이요. Cars were passing by so fast. Yeah, so we could we could be uh die it could be die in there. 자요. We could be die in there. 이걸 어떻게 고쳐야 됩니까? We nearly died. Elon also very good. We almost died. Very nice. 이 nearly 단어가 almost 하고 되게 똑같아요. So we nearly died, we almost died. Okay? 좀 더 고급 sentence가 있어요. Right? I nearly saw my life flash right before my eyes. Okay, 이건 좀 어렵죠. Alright? Wow, 진짜 오랜간만이다. 이 sentence. Right? I nearly saw my life flash right before my eyes. Okay? 근데 좀 어렵잖아요. Right? Right before my eyes는 내 눈 앞에. Okay? 딱 내 눈 앞에 내 life가 인생이 이렇게 사라지는 느낌이었다. 이 약간 이런 느낌이에요. Right? I nearly saw my life flash right before my eyes. 만약에 여러분들이 이 sentence 쓸 수 있으면 wow, very impressive. Extremely impressive. But uh fortunately, yeah, police and ambulance very uh came uh come best and Good. Yeah, and we yeah, we didn't get hurt hurt cars and so 음. 자, 여기서 제가 멈출게요. 일단은 사실 여기 organization 되게 좋았어요. 계속 연습하면서 조금 더 깔끔하게, 이렇게 조금 더 부드럽게 이제 연습하는 거죠. Organization은 되게 좋았습니다. Right? 여기서 바로 얘기했었으면 좋겠습니다. 그러니까 여기서부터 딱 여기 I have a terrible experience, you know. Uh, I was on my way to school, right? And some guy nearly hit us. 막 이런 식으로 right? Or my mom was taking me to school or driving me to school and some guy, some crazy guy nearly hit us. Okay? 그냥 바로 얘기하고 그 다음에 이제 더 했으면 좋겠어요. 근데 not bad though, 핸드 님. 문법은 엑스트라가 많죠. 하지만 사실 생각보다 organization은 괜찮았습니다. He was just talking about the accident. And 거기에서 감정을 좀 이렇게 계속 보여 주고 싶은 마음이 보였어요, 제가. So 일단은 되게 잘했어요, 핸드.
