Question 
I'm sorry, but there is a problem that you need to resolve. You bought a new cell phone and just received it, but unfortunately, it doesn't work. You want to return it to get a new one or solve this problem somehow. Contact the store, explain the situation, and give two or three suggestions to solve the problem.
