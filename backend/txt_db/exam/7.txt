Question 
Step 7: Repeat the response and finish.

Answer 
Oh, bad. That’s bad. Thank you so much. Then I will go to um tomorrow go buy my phone. Bye.

Feedback 
Response was weak. 'Oh, bad. That's bad.' is grammatically incorrect (referencing 'best' earlier). Did not repeat the response. Recommended structure: Reaction + Repeat Response + Feeling. Example: 'Oh, wow. Oh, it has really good speakers. Oh, that’s awesome. Thank you so much for your help.'. The longer closing ('Thank you so much and I will go there tomorrow...') is not bad, but a shorter, cleaner ending is also fine. Examples: 'Thank you so much for your help.' or 'I really appreciate the help. Thank you.'
