질문 내용을 그대로 반복(Echoing)하여 답변을 시작하는 것이 좋습니다. 과거 시제('made')를 정확하게 사용하여 경험을 묘사합니다. 'It is the best way to ~', 'what we need to do is ~', 'make time for ~', 'It never fails to amaze me'와 같은 유용한 패턴과 구어체 표현을 사용합니다. 'It was a real challenge to answer this question'처럼 엄살을 부리는 표현을 사용하여 자연스러움을 더합니다. 답변 내용을 다른 주제(예: 휴가)에도 응용하여 사용하는 전략이 중요합니다.
