Question 
As soon as you got the coffee shop, you found out that your favorite drink is not on the menu. Solve the problem.

Answer 
IH Level: Hi I can't find my favorite drink on the menu. Firstly Can you recommend other drinks? Secondly Can you make my favorite drink? I'm a big fan of this cafe. I'm disappointed. You need to help me right now. AL Level: Hi I'm John. As you know I'm a regular here. But I can't find my favorite latte. What happened? I wonder if you have a recommendation. Secondly If you can make my favorite latte it will be perfect. Which one do you prefer? I believe the latte is real thing. Please let me know as soon as possible.

Feedback 
IH Level: 시키는 내용은 잘 따랐지만, 전체적으로 무난한 답변이었습니다. AL Level: 'regular'와 같은 좋은 단어를 사용하고, 좋아하는 메뉴(latte)를 언급하며 상황을 구체화했습니다. 간접 의문문(I wonder if..., If you can make...)을 두 번 사용했으며, 선택권을 주고 선호를 간접적으로 표현했습니다. 간접 의문문과 연기를 통해 만점을 받을 수 있습니다.
