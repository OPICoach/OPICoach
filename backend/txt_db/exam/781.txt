Question 
설문에서 콘서트 가는 것을 즐긴다고 하셨습니다. 최근에 가본 콘서트에 대해 말해주세요. 콘서트는 어디서 열렸고 누구와 갔나요? 콘서트를 즐겼나요? (You indicate in a survey that you enjoy going to concerts. Tell me about a concert that you have been to recently. Where was the concert held and who did you go with? Did you enjoy the concert?)

Answer 
Recently I went to a concert. I went to BTS concert. BTS is a popular boy band in Korea who became famous with the song called DNA. The song goes like this. [Singing part] I'm a big fan of this boy band. It was held at the Olympic Stadium which is located in 잠실. I love this place or I like this place because It's within walking distance of my house. And it has state of the art facilities. BTS songs are really active and lively. I sang along to songs. And move to the music. So the concert made me feel full of energy. I will never forget that evening.

Feedback 
'Recently', 'last', 'reason' 등의 단어가 들리면 과거 시제로 답변해야 합니다. 질문의 핵심(최근 콘서트)에 집중하세요. 실제 경험이 없다면 BTS 콘서트처럼 준비된 스크립트를 활용하세요. 노래 일부를 부르는 것은 전달력을 높여줍니다. 과거 시제 사용(sang along, moved, made)이 중요합니다. IH 레벨에서는 좀 더 고급스러운 표현('fancy expression')을 사용해 보세요. 유용한 표현: It's within walking distance of my house (집에서 가깝다), state of the art facilities (최신식 시설), sang along to songs (노래를 따라 불렀다), move to the music (음악에 맞춰 몸을 흔들었다). 'make A feel B' 패턴(made me feel full of energy)을 활용하세요. 육하원칙에 맞춰 답변 내용을 구성하세요.
