Feedback 
This question asks about where you usually go hiking and why. The word 'usually' is key, indicating you should answer in the present tense. Practice listening to the question twice and planning your storyline. For IM level, focus on having something to say and clear delivery, the length doesn't need to be long. Key phrases and vocabulary include: 'My favorite place to hike is...', 'It's close to my house' (versatile), 'I love this place because...', 'breathtaking scenery', 'fresh air', 'Hiking helps me relieve my stress and clear my head' (versatile template), 'I'm planning to go again this weekend' (planning to). If a phrase is difficult to pronounce, simplify it (e.g., 'My favorite hiking place is...'). If you can't think of a conclusion, you can simply say 'I love hiking'.
