Question 
Many people enjoy hiking these days. How is hiking different from other types of sports? What are some benefits of hiking?

Answer 
Along with other sports such as jogging and swimming, hiking has been one of the very good sports to keep one's mind and body healthy. I'd like to specifically compare hiking and swimming. Like swimming, hiking requires a person to use entire muscle from head to toe. However, the differences between the two sports outweigh the similarities. First and foremost, the preparation is different. For hiking, you become a light packer. All you need is sneakers. For swimming, it's a different story when it comes to swimming. You need swimsuit, water goggles, towels, and a swimming cap. Oh, and of course, when swimming, people can stop when they are all worn out. But when you think about it, since the major purpose of hiking is to reach the top of the mountain, people are somewhat hesitant to stop climbing. I personally prefer hiking better for several reasons. I can enjoy hiking with a light heart and it doesn't require a lot of skill. You don't need to buy equipment, but you can get enough exercise for your body to stay fit. No matter what, both sports keep your body in shape.

Feedback 
This is an AL level question, typically appearing in higher difficulty levels (5 or 6). It asks for a comparison between hiking and other sports and the benefits of hiking. It's easier to compare hiking to one or two specific sports rather than all. Structure your answer by discussing similarities, differences, and your personal preference (incorporating benefits here). AL requires significant length and good delivery. Use advanced phrases and vocabulary. Key phrases and vocabulary: 'Along with...', 'keep one's mind and body healthy', 'entire muscle', 'from head to toe', 'outweigh the similarities' (or 'similar points' if 'similarities' is hard), 'First and foremost' (fancy alternative to 'First'), 'become a light packer', 'It's a different story when it comes to...', 'Oh, and of course', 'when you think about it', 'major purpose', 'reach the top of the mountain', 'somewhat hesitant', 'with a light heart', 'doesn't require a lot of skill', 'get enough exercise for your body to stay fit', 'stay fit', 'No matter what', 'keep your body in shape'. Fancy expressions are not necessarily difficult words but rather effective phrases. Practice speaking out loud for better delivery.
