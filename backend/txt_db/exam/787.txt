Question 
You need to open a new bank account. Go to the bank and ask a teller three to four questions to open a new account.

Answer 
Start with a greeting (e.g., Good afternoon). State your purpose (e.g., I'd like to open an account). Ask questions about available account types (e.g., What kind of accounts do you offer?). Ask about fees (e.g., Should I pay any fees? If so, how much is it?). Ask about specific services (e.g., Can I get a debit card? Do you have a website?). Ask about operating hours (e.g., What are your hours?). End with thanks (e.g., Thank you for your help).

Feedback 
Use 'I'd like to' for requests. Ask about 'kind of accounts', 'fees', 'website', 'hours'. Use 'debit card' instead of 'check card'. For higher levels, ask about specific accounts (e.g., for college students) and use 'appreciate'. General useful questions for inquiries include: What kind of [noun] do you have/offer? How much is it/are they? Should I pay any fees? Could you tell me the price/total cost? Do you have any recommendations? What are your hours? Where is [something] located? Could you please give me the directions? 'If you don't mind' or 'If it's okay with you' can be used before asking additional questions or requesting to visit.
