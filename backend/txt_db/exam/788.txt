Question 
I'm sorry, there is a problem. You left your bank card at the restaurant where you ate lunch. Call the restaurant and explain the situation. Ask them how to get your missing card.

Answer 
Start the phone call by identifying yourself (e.g., This is [Your Name]). Explain the situation (e.g., I ate lunch at your restaurant and I'm afraid but I left my bank card there). Mention where you think you left it (e.g., I think I left it on the table). Ask them to check or look for it (e.g., Could you please check whether it's there? Could you please look for my card?). For higher levels, express certainty (e.g., I must have left it on the table). Ask about retrieval (e.g., If you find the item, when should I visit to get it? Could you tell me your hours?). Ask them to contact you if found (e.g., Could you please call me if you find it? Please let me know). Provide your phone number. End with thanks.

Feedback 
Use 'This is [Name]' for phone calls. Use 'I'm afraid but' to introduce a problem. Use 'I think I left it' for uncertainty. Use 'look for' to ask them to find it. For AL, use 'must have + past participle' to express certainty about a past action. Ask 'when should I visit' and 'what are your hours'. Use 'call me' or 'let me know' and provide your number. Problem-solving is more important for IH+ levels. 'I didn't know what to do' or 'panicked' are good phrases for being flustered, better than 'embarrassed' unless you mean ashamed.
