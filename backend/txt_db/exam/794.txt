Question 
You indicated in your survey that you like to stay at home during vacations. What do you usually do when you spend your vacation at home? Tell me about the activities you like to do during vacations at home.

Answer 
Yes, I always prefer to stay at home during vacations. So, I'd like to tell you about what I normally do when I spend my vacation at home. As soon as my vacation starts, I just chill out, listening to music. I listen to a lot of music and take a nap during my vacation. Sometimes, I binge watch movies and TV shows on Netflix. I feel like I can escape from my stress while watching my favorite TV shows. And I also like to invite the people around me to my place. When my friends visit me, I usually prepare food for them. I think it's a lot of fun to cook for someone. It makes me happy. Besides, I always love to spend time talking to my friends and family during vacations. So, all in all, a vacation at home is a perfect way for me to relieve stress. I'd have to say my apartment is the best place to spend my vacation. Obviously, you know, I'm such a home body. So, how about you, Eva? Do you stay home during vacations?

Feedback 
This is an IH level answer, showing more detail and advanced expressions than the IM answer. The introduction uses 'always prefer to' instead of 'like to' and a longer, more complex sentence 'I'd like to tell you about what I normally do when I spend my vacation at home'. The body is divided into two parts: relaxing activities and inviting people. It uses vocabulary like 'chill out' (instead of relax), 'binge watch', and adds detail like 'on Netflix'. It uses grammatical structures like comma + '-ing' ('listening to music') and 'while watching'. It expresses feelings ('I feel like I can escape from my stress'). The second part introduces inviting 'the people around me' to 'my place', preparing food ('prepare food for them', 'cook for someone'), expressing enjoyment ('It's a lot of fun to cook', 'It makes me happy'), and using 'spend time talking' (spend time + '-ing'). Transitions like 'Besides' are used. The conclusion uses more sophisticated phrases like 'all in all', 'perfect way to relieve stress', and 'I'd have to say'. It includes conversational elements like 'obviously, you know' and directly addresses the interviewer, Eva, with a question ('So, how about you, Eva? Do you stay home during vacations?').
