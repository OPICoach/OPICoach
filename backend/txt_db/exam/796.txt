Regarding OPIc difficulty levels, you should always choose level 6-6. Choosing a lower level like 3-3 or 5-5 significantly reduces your chances of getting a high score (like AL), even if your English proficiency is high. Experiments show that even a highly proficient speaker might only get IH at level 3-3, while a less proficient speaker might get IM1 at level 6-6.
