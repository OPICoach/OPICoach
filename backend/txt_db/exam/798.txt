It is possible to achieve an AL score even if you only answer the 'combo set' questions (typically questions 2-10) and skip the 'role play' and 'I hate you' sets (questions 11-15), but this is primarily possible when you choose difficulty level 6-6. Choosing a lower level and skipping questions is less likely to result in AL.
