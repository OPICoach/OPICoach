Feedback 
General feedback: Minjin follows the strategies very well, and her message is super clear. Greeting: 'Hi' is better than 'Hi there' in person, but 'Hi' is safe for phone. Introduction: Keep it short and sweet, like 'I want to buy a new phone like iPhone 10'. Question 1: Phrasing 'how much is the iPhone 10 because I have not much money?' is a bit awkward with extra details; 'How much is it?' is clearer. Repeating Response: Repeat the store's response (e.g., 'Oh, that's cheap? Only $1,000?') after your reaction ('Oh, that's cheap; oh, thank you') and before your feeling ('That's great!'). Question 2: 'Does it come in pink?' is recommended phrasing instead of 'so do you have pink one?'. Question 3: 'Does the iPhone 10 come with nice speakers?' is recommended instead of 'so do you have a very nice speaker for my iPhone?'; saying 'my iPhone' implies you already own it; add a phrase like 'Oh, I almost forgot' before the third question. Response to Q3: Minjin's response 'Oh, best, that's best; thank you so much' was weak; use reaction ('Oh, wow!'), repeat ('Oh, it has really good speakers'), and feeling ('Oh, that's awesome! Thank you so much for your help.'). Closing: Keep it short and simple like 'Thank you so much for your help.' instead of 'then I will go to tomorrow for buy my phone; bye; great, thank you.'
