Question 
Please tell me how the weather has changed in your country over the years. Is the weather different from what it used to be? Give me all the details about how the weather has changed.

Answer 
I think things have changed quite a bit recently when it comes to the weather. Like I mentioned, Korea has four seasons, but these days it feels like we only have two, you know, summer and winter. Because they've gotten so much longer, you know? Summer in Korea has become way hotter than before because of like climate change. And winter is less cold with less snow. As far as I remember, it wasn't like this this hot like back in the days when I was a kid. Plus, the weather has become a lot more like unpredictable than it used to be, you know? I think this is a serious problem that needs to be dealt with as soon as possible, but it doesn't seem easy, you know? So, yeah, I think that's all.

This question requires comparing past and present weather and discussing changes. Use the pattern 'I think things have changed quite a bit recently...' to start. Use connecting phrases like 'Like I mentioned' and 'Plus'. Crucially, use the present perfect tense to show change over time ('have changed', 'have gotten', 'has become'). Use comparative forms ('longer', 'hotter', 'less cold', 'more unpredictable'). The pattern 'has become + comparative' is very useful here. Use phrases to refer to the past like 'back in the days when I was a kid' or 'used to be'. 'Unpredictable' is key vocabulary for describing modern weather changes. The concluding phrase 'I think this is a serious problem that needs to be dealt with as soon as possible, but it doesn't seem easy' is an AL-level template for social issues, useful if you can manage it, but not strictly necessary for lower levels. Focus on demonstrating the required grammar (present perfect, comparatives, past tense/used to) and relevant vocabulary.
