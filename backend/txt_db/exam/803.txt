Question 
Have you experienced any unexpected incident caused by the severe weather? Or have you heard about any incident related to inclement weather? What was the problem and how was the problem dealt with?

Answer 
Well, it's not really a specific incident or anything, but I've been really struggling with the heat this summer, you know? I've been enjoying running lately, but it's been so hot that I can't run in the mornings or afternoons at all. Also, a few days ago, I was taking the subway to school and I felt so dizzy, you know? I was sweating so much, like I just couldn't stand the heat. Seriously, I almost passed out. Right after I got off the subway, I went to a nearby convenience store and bought some cold water. Also, when I hung out with my friends near school, like it was so hot that we couldn't do so much. You know, we ended up just talking and studying in a cafe nearby, you know? It's not like something big happened, but it's like a personal experience of how tough the weather has been for me. Or, for AL/related topic: Um well, is it okay if I talk about something kind of different but related? Actually, the government has set up cooling shelters near bus stops and subway station. They have air conditioning, you know? So you can escape the heat, you can cool off while waiting for public transport.

Feedback 
This question asks for a weather-related experience. The key is to use the past tense fluently. You don't need a dramatic story; a simple personal experience is fine. Start with a phrase like 'Well, it's not really a specific incident or anything...' to manage expectations. Describe the situation using past tense ('was taking', 'felt', 'was sweating', 'couldn't stand', 'almost passed out', 'went', 'bought', 'hung out', 'couldn't do', 'ended up'). Useful phrases include 'struggling with the heat', 'felt so dizzy', 'couldn't stand the heat', and 'almost passed out' (meaning nearly fainted or collapsed). 'End up ing' is a great phrasal verb to show what you eventually did ('we ended up just talking and studying'). Conclude by summarizing it as a personal experience ('It's not like something big happened, but it's like a personal experience...'). The alternative AL-level response about cooling shelters is a way to talk about a related topic if you lack a personal story, using the phrase 'Is it okay if I talk about something kind of different but related?'. Vocabulary like 'cooling shelters' and 'cool off' is useful here, but don't force difficult words if they hinder fluency. Focus on smooth narration in the past tense.
