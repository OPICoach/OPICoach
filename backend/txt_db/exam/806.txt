Question 
Please talk about the changes being made to what people think of health from the past to now.

Answer 
Um, there have been a lot of changes in what people think of health from the past to now. Ages and ages ago, in my parents' generation, they had no time to think about health. They were busy working 24/7. But now it's totally different. We spend lots and lots of time on eating healthy food and exercising. Many people believe in 'You are what you eat'. Living a healthy life is trending these days.

Feedback 
Use 'past to now' to indicate comparison. 'Mindset' is the English word for 인식. 'There have been a lot of changes in...' is a versatile phrase for describing changes. 'Ages and ages ago' means 'in the past'. 'But now it's totally different' is a great transition for comparing past and present. 'spend time on' is a basic pattern. Note the pronunciation of 'healthy'. 'exercising' or 'work out' can be used for 운동하다. 'work out on a regular basis' means exercising regularly. 'spend lots and lots of time' is an emphatic way to say 'a lot of time'. 'Many people believe in...' is useful for stating common beliefs. 'You are what you eat' is a trendy and high-scoring phrase. 'is trending these days' is a useful pattern for current trends. Don't memorize the whole script; pick up useful phrases.
