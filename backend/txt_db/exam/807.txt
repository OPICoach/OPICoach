Question 
Please talk about an issue related to health in your neighborhood.

Answer 
Um, this question is really difficult, but I will try my best to answer. I think one big issue related to health in my neighborhood is COVID-19 pandemic. Many people got infected all over the world. And this pandemic has totally changed our lives. People including myself cannot go abroad and have family gatherings. We cannot even go to work sometimes. So, I hope it ends in the near future.

Feedback 
'Um, this question is really difficult, but I will try my best to answer' is a useful opening for difficult questions; it sounds natural and can boost your score. Note the pronunciation of 'think'. 'one big issue related to health is...' is a direct way to state the issue. 'got infected' means 감염되다. 'all over the world' means 전 세계적으로. 'has totally changed our lives' highlights the significant impact; 'totally' adds emphasis, and 'lives' is the plural of 'life'. 'People including myself' is a good phrase to include yourself and sounds more sophisticated. 'cannot go abroad', 'have family gatherings', 'go to work' are specific examples of the impact. 'I hope it ends in the near future' is a good closing for issues; 'in the near future' means 머지않은 미래에. Other possible issues include fine dust (미세먼지).
