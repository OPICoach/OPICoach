Question 
Can you tell me about where you live? What does your home look like? And what types of rooms does it have?

Answer 
Okay. Let me tell you about where I live. I live alone in a small apartment in downtown Seoul. Actually, my apartment is a studio, so I don't have a bedroom. However, there's a nice bathroom and a spacious kitchen area. My apartment has some furniture like a bed, a closet, and a coffee table.

Focus on delivery to improve score. Key aspects include: 1. Accurate pronunciation and stress (e.g., apartment, furniture). 2. Natural linking sounds (연음) between words (e.g., live in an, is a). 3. Natural intonation (억양): Vary pitch, raise pitch for emphasis or before commas/non-final clauses (e.g., "Actually," "studio, so"), lower pitch at the end of sentences. Emphasize negation (e.g., "don't have a bedroom"). Use rising intonation for items in a list except the last one. 4. Speed variation (속도): Adjust pace within sentences, slightly slowing down for important phrases (e.g., "a small apartment") and speeding up for less crucial parts (e.g., "I live in a"). Maintain speed within meaningful units (e.g., "where I live", "downtown Seoul"). 5. Use gestures (제스처) while practicing to enhance naturalness and delivery, even though not recorded. Practice with the model answer applying these techniques.
