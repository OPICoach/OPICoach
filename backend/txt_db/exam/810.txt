Question 
In your background survey, you mentioned that you like going to parks. Please tell me about the park you like to go to. Where is it located, and what does it look like? What makes it special?

Answer 
I really like going to parks, so I've been to several nice parks in my country. So, let me tell you about one of the parks I like to visit. Actually, there is a nice park called Han River Park in my city, Seoul. The park runs along Han River, which divides Seoul into north and south. Fortunately, this park is pretty close to my home. Um, it's only about a 10 to 15 minute drive from where I live. In addition, what makes the park special is that there are some great facilities, like exercise equipment and walking paths. Also, there are biking trails throughout the park, and several places have bikes for rent. On top of that, it's got tons of trees and flowers, and the cherry blossoms are my favorite part because they begin to blossom and give off an incredible scent in the spring. I can say Han River Park is an excellent place to hang out with friends and family. Honestly, the park gets quite crowded on weekends, but I think it's a perfect place to enjoy nature.

Feedback 
Excellent response addressing all parts of the question. The answer starts with a clear statement of preference and introduces the specific park. Phrases like 'runs along Han River, which divides Seoul into north and south' provide good descriptive detail. Mentioning the proximity ('pretty close to my home', '10 to 15 minute drive') is specific and personal. The use of linking words like 'In addition' and 'On top of that' helps structure the description of facilities and features. Describing the cherry blossoms and their 'incredible scent' adds sensory detail. The concluding sentences summarize the park's appeal and add a realistic note about crowds, showing balanced perspective. Vocabulary like 'great facilities', 'biking trails', 'tons of trees', 'excellent place to hang out', and 'quite crowded' is appropriate and varied.
