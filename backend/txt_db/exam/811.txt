Question 
What kind of activities do you usually do at the park? Do you take walks or exercise at the park? Do you prefer to go there with others or do you prefer to go alone? Please describe a typical day at the park.

Answer 
There are some great parks in my city. My favorite one is only about 10 minutes from my home, so I like to go there and spend time in nature. So, I go to the park at least two to three times a week, and I typically go alone because I like to exercise early in the morning. But when I want to just take a walk or have a picnic in the spring, I go with my friends or family. Actually, the main activity I do at the park would have to be jogging. The park is great for that because it has a nice walking path. So, my typical routine consists of jogging 5 or 6 kilometers, which takes about 30 to 40 minutes. When I have enough energy, I do some exercises on the workout machines. And then, I normally stretch my arms and legs and just cool down. I love my workouts at the park because I always feel so healthy and refreshed afterwards. Personally, going to the park is my favorite way to get rid of stress.

Feedback 
This answer effectively describes typical activities and preferences at the park. It clearly states the frequency ('at least two to three times a week') and who the speaker goes with ('typically go alone', 'with my friends or family'), addressing parts of the question directly. The main activity, jogging, is identified, and specific details like distance ('5 or 6 kilometers') and time ('30 to 40 minutes') make the description vivid. The inclusion of other activities like using 'workout machines' and the cool-down routine adds depth. The concluding sentences explaining the feeling ('so healthy and refreshed') and benefit ('get rid of stress') provide a strong personal connection and effectively summarize the experience. Phrases like 'spend time in nature', 'typical routine consists of', and 'get rid of stress' are well-used.
