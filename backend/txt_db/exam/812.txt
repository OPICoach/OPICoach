Question 
Tell me about a memorable experience you have had at the park. When was it? What were you doing? Who are you with? What made the experience so memorable? Give me all the details.

Answer 
The most memorable experience I've ever had at the park was a fireworks festival. It was last fall in October. My best friend and I went to a park because the city had a fireworks festival there. The festival was held in a huge riverside park called Han River Park in Seoul. The park was full of families, friends, and couples. The show started at 9:00 p.m. and lasted nearly two hours, but it seemed much shorter because I was enjoying it very much. Every fireworks display was unique, and it was something I'd never seen before. Actually, what made the festival so memorable was the setting and atmosphere. The fireworks exploded above the river, so we could see the reflection in the water. And in the background, we could see the beautiful city lights. The atmosphere was so upbeat and cheerful because there were so many people. Everybody in the park, including myself and my friend, was smiling, taking photos and videos the entire time. Overall, it was such a pleasant experience, and I'd like to go to another fireworks festival this year.

Feedback 
This is a well-structured narrative about a memorable event. It clearly identifies the event ('fireworks festival'), time ('last fall in October'), and companion ('My best friend and I'). The description of the setting ('huge riverside park', 'full of families, friends, and couples') and the event itself (start time, duration, unique displays) is detailed. The answer effectively addresses what made it memorable by focusing on the 'setting and atmosphere', providing specific visual details like the 'reflection in the water' and 'beautiful city lights'. Describing the mood as 'upbeat and cheerful' and people's actions ('smiling, taking photos and videos') brings the scene to life. The concluding sentence summarizes the positive experience and expresses a future desire, providing a nice wrap-up. Phrases like 'seemed much shorter because I was enjoying it very much', 'something I'd never seen before', 'exploded above the river', and 'such a pleasant experience' are strong.
