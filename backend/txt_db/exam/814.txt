Question 
How has the technology you use changed over the years? What is the difference between the technology you used in the past and the technology you use now? Describe in details.

Answer 
Hmm, well, this is another hard one. I mean, I haven't thought about this kind of question. I guess I've noticed some changes in technology over the past few years. So, hmm. I can probably compare the phones in the past to the phones of today. Actually, when I was a kid, I didn't have a cell phone until like 15. It's because cell phones were very expensive and they were not as common back then. The phones used to be much bigger in size and less portable. On top of that, they didn't have various features like today's smartphones. You know, we could just make phone calls and send text messages. However, these days, phones are cheaper and a lot more common than before. Unlike the phones in the past, they have a lot of functions and brilliant features. To give you some examples, you can take really good pictures and videos, video call for free, send your friend a gift, etc. So overall, it's definitely true that technologies like phones are totally different from the past. And I think they have changed for the better.

Feedback 
The speaker again acknowledges the difficulty but successfully compares past and present phone technology. The use of 'Hmm, well, this is another hard one' and 'I mean, I haven't thought about this kind of question' adds naturalness. The comparison is structured well, contrasting cost, commonness, size/portability, and features. Phrases like 'used to be much bigger' and 'less portable' effectively describe past phones. The transition 'However, these days' clearly marks the shift to present technology. Specific examples of modern features ('take really good pictures and videos', 'video call for free', 'send your friend a gift') are concrete and relatable. The conclusion summarizes the difference ('totally different') and offers an opinion ('changed for the better'). Vocabulary like 'various features', 'brilliant features', and 'definitely true' is well-used.
