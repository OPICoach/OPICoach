Question 
Can you remember a time when you had a problem using your phone? What was the problem and how did it happen? How did you solve it?

Answer 
Well, I remember a time when I had an experience like this a few years ago. One day, my phone wasn't working properly when I was trying to text my friend. Actually, I was supposed to meet up with my friend for dinner that night, but then the phone suddenly wouldn't turn on, so I just didn't know what to do. But luckily, my sister was at home and I was able to use her phone. And you know what? I found my friend on Instagram, so I sent her a DM and told her to wait for me at a restaurant. Honestly, though, I tried everything I could think of to get my phone back to work, but it was no use. So the next day, I ended up taking it to a service center and the technician repaired it right away. Actually, he just replaced the battery. Yeah. So, I didn't have to buy a new phone.

Feedback 
This is a clear narrative describing a specific problem and its resolution. The story is easy to follow, starting with the problem ('phone wasn't working properly', 'suddenly wouldn't turn on') and the context (meeting a friend). The speaker effectively describes their immediate reaction ('didn't know what to do'). The solution is presented in steps: first, the temporary fix using a sister's phone and Instagram ('found my friend on Instagram', 'sent her a DM'), and then the long-term fix ('ended up taking it to a service center'). The detail about the technician replacing the battery provides a satisfying conclusion to the problem. Phrases like 'wasn't working properly', 'suddenly wouldn't turn on', 'didn't know what to do', 'But luckily', 'tried everything I could think of', 'it was no use', and 'ended up taking it to a service center' are all well-chosen and contribute to a fluent story.
