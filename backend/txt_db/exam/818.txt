Question 
There's a problem that you must take care of. You've bought concert tickets for yourself and a friend, but you can't make it due to illness. Call your friend to explain the situation and suggest two or three alternatives to the problem.

Answer 
Ring ring, ring ring. Hi John. It's me, Jenna. How are you? I'm good. Is this a good time to talk? Okay. I'm calling because I have some bad news to share with you. I know we're supposed to see a concert tonight, but I don't think I can make it. I started feeling kind of sick yesterday and it's worse now. Yeah, I don't know. I just have a very bad headache and my throat really hurts. Yeah, I'm really sorry. So I was wondering, why don't you go with your brother instead? I remember you said he really likes music, so I thought he might be interested. Yeah, ask him and let me know because I'd be happy to give him my ticket for free. Well, if that's not an option, do you think we can sell the tickets online right now? I bet many people would be interested because the tickets are all sold out now. Um, or how about we call the theater and ask for a refund? Not sure, but I have their number, so I can call them and ask. Yeah, I'm really sorry, John, but seriously, I'm feeling horrible. So I'll see a doctor tomorrow morning. Oh, thank you. Let me know what you would like to do, okay? All right. Talk to you later. Bye.

Feedback 
This roleplay effectively addresses the problem and provides multiple solutions. The speaker starts with a natural phone call opening and greeting. The problem is clearly stated ('I have some bad news', 'I don't think I can make it') and the reason (illness) is explained with specific symptoms ('very bad headache', 'throat really hurts'). The speaker apologizes sincerely ('I'm really sorry'). Three clear alternatives are suggested: 1) friend goes with brother ('why don't you go with your brother instead?'), offering the ticket for free; 2) sell tickets online ('sell the tickets online right now?'); and 3) ask for a refund ('how about we call the theater and ask for a refund?'). The speaker shows initiative by offering to call the theater. The closing sentences reiterate the apology and illness and leave the final decision to the friend, showing consideration. Phrases like 'supposed to see a concert', 'feeling kind of sick', 'very bad headache', 'really sorry', 'why don't you... instead?', 'if that's not an option', 'sell the tickets online', 'ask for a refund', and 'Let me know what you would like to do' are all appropriate and well-used in this context.
