Question 
What do you usually do at the beach? When do you go to the beach? And who do you usually go with? Tell me about the activities you do at the beach.

Answer 
This is a good question because I love going to the beach and spending time in nature. Sometimes, I take a short beach trip with my close friends. And also, my family and I love to go camping to the beach park. I guess we go at least three to four times a year during the spring. Our typical routine at the beach includes relaxing and sunbathing while listening to music. And during the day, we love to swim in the ocean and take lots of pictures and videos. Oh, you know what the best part is? We always make sure to watch the sunset at the beach while having the barbecue dinner. You know, cooking and eating delicious grilled steak outdoors would always have to be an eye-opening experience. So, I think beach camping is my favorite thing to do when I want to relieve stress from work and study. There is nothing like falling asleep to the sound of waves crashing on the beach. Can you imagine? Splosh. Splosh. Splosh.

Feedback 
The answer directly addresses the questions about activities, frequency, and companions. It uses good descriptive language for activities (e.g., 'relaxing and sunbathing', 'swim in the ocean', 'take lots of pictures and videos'). The phrase 'You know what the best part is?' is a natural conversational connector. Describing the barbecue dinner adds specific detail. The sentence 'cooking and eating delicious grilled steak outdoors would always have to be an eye-opening experience' is a bit wordy and slightly awkward; 'is always a great experience' or 'is always memorable' might be more concise. The conclusion about stress relief and the sound of waves is a nice touch, adding personal feeling and sensory detail.
