Question 
When was the last time you went to the beach? Where did you go? Who did you go with? Describe what you did on your trip in as much detail as you can.

Answer 
The last time I went to the beach was when I was on vacation in Hawaii two years ago. There was a long weekend because of a national holiday, so my family and I went on a trip to Oahu Island, Hawaii. On the second day of our trip, we went to a beautiful beach on the west side of the island. Actually, I don't remember the name of the beach at the moment, but I heard it's one of the island's most beautiful beaches. It's also pretty well known for its nice campground. So, we spent two nights there and did tons of fun activities. The first thing we did in the morning was pitch our tent and a table at the campsite. And during the day, we walked along the beach, swam a lot, and then just relaxed soaking up some sun. Back at our campsite, we grilled some beef and seafood. Then we had a really nice barbecue dinner with beer while watching the sunset at the beach. It was really a jaw-dropping sunset, so I still remember how beautiful it was. Well, I would say it was such a memorable holiday with my family.

Feedback 
This answer provides a clear narrative of the last beach trip, covering when, where, who, and what was done. The chronological description of activities (pitching tent, walking, swimming, relaxing, grilling, dinner, watching sunset) is easy to follow. Vocabulary like 'long weekend', 'national holiday', 'tons of fun activities', 'pitch our tent', 'soaking up some sun', and 'jaw-dropping sunset' is strong and descriptive. The phrase 'I don't remember the name... but I heard it's one of the island's most beautiful beaches' is a natural way to handle not having a specific detail. The conclusion 'such a memorable holiday' effectively summarizes the experience.
