Question 
Tell me about a healthy person you know. What makes that person healthy? Describe in detail what makes that person healthier.

Answer 
I think this is a good question because a lot of people around me care about their health. So, it's it's kind of hard to choose one person, but I would have to talk about my father. Actually, he does several different things to keep himself healthy. First of all, he thinks that eating healthy is the best way to maintain health. So, he always tries to have healthy meals at home. To give you some examples, he usually eats whole grains such as oatmeal and brown rice instead of processed foods. Plus, he often makes a healthy salad with colorful fruits and vegetables. It seems like he doesn't really eat out much, although we sometimes get food delivered when there's a family get-together. And what else? Oh, another thing he does to stay healthy is regular exercise. He goes to the park for a run on a daily basis, and sometimes he hikes the nearby mountain. Yeah, so I can say he's a very fit and energetic man.

Feedback 
The answer starts by acknowledging the question and explaining the choice, which is a good conversational opening. It clearly identifies the person (father) and provides specific, detailed examples of his healthy habits related to both diet and exercise. Transition words like 'First of all', 'To give you some examples', 'Plus', and 'Another thing' help organize the points effectively. The vocabulary is precise (e.g., 'maintain health', 'whole grains', 'processed foods', 'regular exercise', 'on a daily basis', 'fit and energetic'). The description is thorough and directly answers what makes the person healthy.
