Question 
What are some things you have tried for your health? Did you try eating healthy foods or did you work out to become healthier? Tell me everything about the things you have tried to stay healthy.

Answer 
Well, I guess I want to tell you about my favorite workouts that I've been enjoying. And they are yoga and Pilates. I've been practicing yoga and Pilates for more than five years now. And I have to say that I've become a lot healthier since I started doing them on a daily basis. I took a class at least like twice a week, but when I'm busy with work, I just try and practice at home too. You know, regular workouts definitely inspire me to keep in shape. Thanks to yoga and Pilates, I've lost a few kilos and I've definitely improved my posture and flexibility. So, I would highly recommend yoga as well as Pilates to those who want to get back in shape and to get healthier in general. Well, speaking of which, I think being healthy is the most important thing in life. So I feel like I should try and make more efforts besides exercise. I absolutely need to eat more healthy meals, get more sleep, and just be happier physically and mentally. Yes, that's pretty much it.

Feedback 
The answer focuses on specific activities (yoga and Pilates) and provides details about the duration and frequency of practice. It clearly states the benefits gained (e.g., 'become a lot healthier', 'keep in shape', 'lost a few kilos', 'improved my posture and flexibility'). The recommendation at the end is a good addition. The phrase 'at least like twice a week' uses 'like' as a filler, which is common in spoken English but could be omitted for formality ('at least twice a week'). 'I just try and practice' could be 'I just try to practice'. The concluding paragraph broadens the scope to other aspects of health, showing a comprehensive understanding. Vocabulary like 'on a daily basis', 'keep in shape', 'posture and flexibility', and 'highly recommend' is well-used.
