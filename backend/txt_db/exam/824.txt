Question 
What are some issues or concerns related to health in the news? Choose one of the health related issues you've read or heard recently. Talk about that issue in details.

Answer 
Oh wow. This is a very hard one because I haven't really thought about it. I mean, to be honest, I hardly find time to watch the news these days. But I guess there have always been several issues related to health. So, let's see. Oh, I remember reading the news about COVID-19 and vaccines for COVID-19. You know, COVID-19 pandemic has been a serious concern since January 2020. Yeah, it's been quite a long time. So I'll just briefly talk about it. You see, the pandemic has caused a lot of problems in our lives and affected the world in many ways. Fortunately, COVID-19 vaccination has begun in many parts of the world, including in South Korea. So, we're all really hoping the coronavirus pandemic will end soon and hopefully, we won't have to wear a mask every day. Personally though, what I learned is that it's very important to practice good hygiene in our daily lives and strengthen our immune system to fight the virus. So generally, I feel like I have to care more about my health and immune system.

Feedback 
The answer effectively handles a potentially difficult question by acknowledging the challenge upfront ('very hard one', 'hardly find time to watch the news'). Choosing COVID-19 is highly relevant and allows for a detailed response. The answer discusses the duration, impact ('caused a lot of problems', 'affected the world'), solutions (vaccination), and personal hopes and learnings ('practice good hygiene', 'strengthen our immune system'). The structure is logical and easy to follow. Vocabulary like 'serious concern', 'pandemic', 'vaccination', 'good hygiene', and 'immune system' is appropriate for the topic. The concluding sentence summarizing a personal takeaway is a good way to end.
