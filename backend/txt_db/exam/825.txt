Question 
I'd like to give you a situation to act out. Your friend invited you to a party, so you would like to know about when the party starts and what you should bring there. Call your friend and ask two or three questions about the party.

Answer 
Ring ring. Ring ring. Hey John, it's me, Jenna. How's it going? Yeah, I'm good. Not much. Hey, I wanted to say thank you for inviting me to the party. I'm really excited to see you guys this weekend. Well, actually, I have a few questions about the party. So, I was wondering, can you tell me what time the party starts? I wasn't sure if it's six or seven. Oh, okay then. I'll be there by six. And should I bring some food or drinks? Oh, perfect. It's a BYOB party. All right. I'll make sure to bring some beer or my favorite wine. And one more thing. I wonder if I should take my car. I mean, will I be able to park there? The last time I was there, I had to take a bus, but I wasn't sure if there was enough space to park. Okay, cool. I'll drive this time. Thanks John. I'm so looking forward to the party. I'll see you on Saturday. Yep. Have a good one.

Feedback 
This roleplay response is excellent. It uses natural conversational language for a phone call ('Ring ring', 'Hey John, it's me', 'How's it going?'). It expresses gratitude and excitement appropriately ('thank you for inviting me', 'really excited'). The questions asked ('what time the party starts?', 'should I bring some food or drinks?', 'will I be able to park there?') directly fulfill the task requirements. The inclusion of responding to implied answers ('Oh, okay then', 'Oh, perfect', 'Okay, cool') makes the conversation sound very realistic. Phrases like 'I was wondering', 'I wasn't sure if', and 'I mean' add to the natural flow. The closing ('looking forward to', 'See you', 'Have a good one') is also very natural.
