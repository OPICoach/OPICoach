Question 
There is a problem you need to resolve. You're going to be late for the party because you just had a car accident. Call your friend to explain the situation and suggest some alternatives to the problem.

Answer 
Ring ring, ring ring. Hey, how are you? Oh, you're already at the party. Great. Well, I'm calling because I've got some bad news. I was on my way there, but I just had a car accident. Yeah, I'm sorry. But I don't think I can make it on time. You know, this might take a while actually. I called my insurance company and and they said they'll send a person here, so I'm still waiting. Well, I was thinking, why do you guys start eating dinner? Yeah, don't wait for me. I don't know how long I have to wait until things are taken care of. Oh, I'm all right. Yeah, my car is fine too. Okay, I'll be there as soon as things are taken care of. So don't wait for me and start having dinner without me. Yeah. I'll text when I'm on my way. Okay. Bye.

Feedback 
This roleplay response successfully explains the problem and suggests alternatives. It starts with a natural phone opening and reacts to the friend's status ('Oh, you're already at the party. Great.'). The problem is clearly stated ('got some bad news', 'just had a car accident'). An apology is included ('I'm sorry'). The consequence (being late) is explained, along with the reason for the delay ('might take a while', 'called my insurance company', 'still waiting'). The suggestions for alternatives ('why do you guys start eating dinner?', 'don't wait for me', 'start having dinner without me') are appropriate and directly address the task. Reassuring the friend about personal safety ('Oh, I'm all right') adds realism. The closing ('text when I'm on my way', 'Bye') is natural for a phone call. The repetition of 'and and' is a minor speech disfluency common in spoken language.
