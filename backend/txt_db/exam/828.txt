Question 
You indicated in the survey that you prefer to stay at home during your vacations. How do you spend your vacations at home? Describe the activities you like to do when you spend your vacation at home.

Answer 
Well, I have to say this is a great question because I love staying at home. Actually, I don't really do anything too active when I'm home for vacations. This is because honestly, I get tired from work and I generally prefer to rest at home. So I would say I'm kind of a home body. And you know, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it's definitely a better idea to spend time at home. So let me tell you about what I like to do when I spend my vacation at home. Basically, I get kind of lazy. Haha. So what I like to do includes listening to good music and taking a nap. Listening to my favorite songs, chilling, and lying in bed is my favorite thing to do. In addition, I love to watch a good movie or TV shows on Netflix. There are so many good shows and movies on Netflix, but I especially enjoy watching thrillers and dramas. So overall, spending my vacation at home is a perfect way for me to relieve stress. And you know, there's nowhere else like home sweet home. So I'm grateful that I have my own place to stay comfortably. Speaking of which, I can't wait for my next vacation.

Feedback 
Your answer is fluent and natural. You use conversational phrases like 'Well' and 'you know'. Good vocabulary like 'home body' and 'relieve stress'.
- 'when I'm home for vacations': 'on vacation' or 'for vacation' (singular) is more common.
- 'watch a good movie or TV shows': Should be 'watch good movies or TV shows' (plural) or 'watch a good movie or a TV show' (singular/singular).
