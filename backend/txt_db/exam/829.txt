Question 
When you spend your vacation at home, who usually visits you? What do you like to do together? Give me all the details.

Answer 
During my vacation at home, I generally spend time alone. I mean, I truly appreciate enjoying my vacation alone. But sometimes, I invite my family or close friends to my place. When we get together in my place, I guess we just eat a lot and talk. We love to eat good food, but you know, you can't just eat good food. You've got to talk about it too. So we talk a lot and have fun while eating and drinking. Oh, so actually, when my friends or family come over to my home, I try and cook something special for them, like pasta and salads. Honestly, though, I can't say I'm a great cook, but cooking for my beloved family and friends makes me happy. Or, we also get food delivered like pizza, sushi, things like that. You know, it's always a pleasure to hang out with good people and spend good quality time with them.

Feedback 
A very natural and detailed response. You effectively describe both spending time alone and with others.
- 'in my place': 'at my place' or 'at my home' is more standard when referring to location.
- 'I try and cook': 'I try to cook' is the standard grammatical form, though 'try and' is common in informal speech.
- 'things like that': A useful phrase to expand on examples.
- 'hang out with good people and spend good quality time': Good vocabulary.
