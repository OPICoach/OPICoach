Question 
Tell me about the last time you spent your vacation at home. When was it? What did you do that made it so memorable?

Answer 
The last time I stayed home for my vacation was last Christmas. Last Christmas, I gave you my heart. Haha. Yes, it was during the Christmas week in 2020. There was a long weekend because of the Christmas holiday. So I invited my best friend Jesse to my apartment. Basically, we both had nothing to do, so we decided to hang out in my apartment. Well, we were kind of tired from work though, so we didn't do anything too active. My friend came over to my apartment around like 2 or 3 in the afternoon, and the first thing we did was drink coffee with some Christmas cookies and cakes. We talked a lot while eating those delicious Christmas desserts. Then we got our favorite Thai food delivered and watched our favorite Netflix series while eating and drinking beer. Oh, so we watched a show called Stranger Things. Have you watched Stranger Things? Oh my gosh, it's so good. We both loved it and watched like four or five episodes that night. And later that night, we went to the park near my home and walked around my neighborhood because it snowed that night. Yeah, so I can say it was a memorable vacation, and I'm looking forward to spending my next vacation with Jesse.

Feedback 
Excellent storytelling! You provide specific details and make the answer engaging.
- 'Last Christmas, I gave you my heart. Haha.': Adding humor is great for naturalness.
- 'hang out in my apartment': Again, 'at my apartment' is more standard.
- 'the first thing we did was drink coffee': Should be past tense 'drank coffee' as you are narrating past events.
- 'around like 2 or 3', 'watched like four or five episodes': 'like' is a common filler word, try to reduce its use in formal settings, but it adds naturalness here.
- 'Have you watched Stranger Things? Oh my gosh, it's so good.': Directly addressing the examiner is a good way to show engagement.
