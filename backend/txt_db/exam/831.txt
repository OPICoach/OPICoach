Question 
Tell me about the bank you often go to. What is it like? Where is it located? What hours is it open? Talk about it in details.

Answer 
Hmm, the bank I often visit? Honestly, I prefer to use online service, so I have to say I hardly visit banks. I mean, I can care of all sorts of things with my phone using mobile banking, so I don't really have to visit banks. Well, but speaking of the banks in my country, I feel like banks are everywhere because I live in a big city, Seoul. There are about six major banks to choose from, and they're typically open from 9:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. Not sure though. So, if you go inside a bank, you'll see a customer lobby and windows with bankers. And also, there are several ATMs outside each bank branch. Oh, one more thing. The employees are always very knowledgeable and kind. I love their great service.

Feedback 
Good strategy to explain why you don't visit banks often and then pivot to talking about banks in general in your country.
- 'I can care of all sorts of things': Should be 'I can take care of all sorts of things'.
- 'windows with bankers': The people at the windows are usually called 'tellers' or 'bank tellers'. 'Bankers' is a broader term.
- 'Not sure though': Adds a touch of natural uncertainty, which is fine.
- 'employees are always very knowledgeable and kind': Good detail about the service.
