Question 
Banks have changed over the years. How were banks when you were young? How are they different from what they look like now? Have there been any changes? Describe the changes in detail.

Answer 
Wow, this is a really complicated question. So you're asking me to compare the banks in the past to the banks now? Well, I haven't thought about this. I mean, when I was young, I didn't really visit banks and I don't quite remember what they were like back in the past. But I guess over the years, I've noticed a few changes. I think the key difference would have to be the size and facilities. When I was a kid, I remember banks were kind of small and crowded. They didn't have many ATMs back then, so I think we had to speak to a teller to withdraw money. On the other hand, the bank I go to these days is much bigger and less crowded. It has lots of ATMs and there are also many windows with bankers. So it's probably a lot more convenient than in the past.

Feedback 
You handle a potentially difficult question well by focusing on observable changes.
- 'Wow, this is a really complicated question.': Acknowledging the question's nature is fine.
- 'I didn't really visit banks and I don't quite remember': It's okay to state you don't have strong memories, then discuss general changes.
- 'speak to a teller': Correct use of 'teller' here.
- 'many windows with bankers': Again, 'tellers' is more specific for the window staff.
- 'much bigger and less crowded', 'lots of ATMs': Good descriptive language for the changes.
