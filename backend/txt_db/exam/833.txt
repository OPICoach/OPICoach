Question 
Problems can occur when you are at a bank. Have you ever experienced a problem at a bank? For instance, you could forget to bring along your ID with you. What was the problem and how did you solve it?

Answer 
I had an experience like this a few years ago. One day around New Year's Day, I was low on cash before visiting my parents, so I went to an ATM nearby. Just so you know, my plan was to give my parents cash as a gift to celebrate the New Year. The problem was the ATM malfunctioned and it ate my credit card. I tried everything I could think of to get it to work, but it was no use. So, I ended up calling the number on the ATM and they sent the technician right away. Luckily, the technician showed up a few minutes later and retrieved my card for me. Can you imagine how frustrating it was? Phew, seriously, I could breathe again because I really needed cash that day.
