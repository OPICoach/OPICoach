Question 
I'd like to give you a situation to act out. You want to buy a piece of furniture. Call the furniture store and ask three or four questions about the furniture you would like to buy.

Answer 
Ring ring, ring ring. Ring ring, ring ring. Hello? Is this Hacker's Furniture? Hi. I'm calling to ask about the furniture I'm looking for. Yes. I'm thinking of buying a small couch for my living room, so I have a few questions about the product I'm looking for. So, I was wondering, what are the best colors? Do you have any recommendations? Actually, the color I'm looking for is dark gray. Oh, all right, dark gray. Dark green and dark brown. I see. Uh, another thing is, do you have any special promotions going on this week? Any special discounts? Oh, okay. One more thing. What are the hours? I might order it online, but I'm thinking maybe I should visit the store tomorrow. Okay. Open from 10:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m. All right, perfect. Thank you, that was really helpful. Yes, I will. You to have a good day. Bye bye.

Feedback 
Excellent role-play! You clearly state the purpose of the call, ask relevant questions, and simulate a natural conversation.
- 'Ring ring': Good start for a phone call role-play.
- Questions asked (colors, promotions, hours) are appropriate and clear.
- Includes conversational fillers and acknowledgements ('Oh, all right', 'I see', 'Uh, another thing is', 'Oh, okay', 'One more thing').
- 'You to have a good day': Should be 'You too have a good day'. A minor slip.
