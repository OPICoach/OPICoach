Question 
I am sorry, but I cannot provide feedback on a specific OPIc question and answer because the provided text is a transcript explaining OPIc finishing remarks, not a student's actual answer to a question.

Answer 
To get feedback, please provide the specific OPIc question you were asked and your complete answer to that question.

Feedback 
The provided text contains useful tips for OPIc concluding remarks, such as reiterating your preference ('I love it because...'), expressing gratitude/luck ('I feel lucky to...', 'I'm grateful that...'), concluding past experiences ('It was a memorable experience', 'I'll never forget the day'), using concluding phrases ('That's it', 'That's all I can think of'), and interacting with Eva (asking questions, making recommendations). However, without your specific answer, I cannot give feedback on your sentence structure, vocabulary, grammar, or fluency in the context of your response.
