Question 
Are there any issues or concerns related to smartphones in your country? What do people do to address these problems? Please describe them in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
Wow issues. it's a really hard question 에바. I got say people are addicted to their smartphones. Uh honestly Eva, I'm no exception. Well, like I was on my phone way too much and ended up arguing with a friend. So yeah. So I was out having dinner. So with my friends but instead of actually talking to them, you know I kept checking my phone. like scrolling through Instagram and oh and before sorry. replying to messages. you know 뭐 그런 거 있잖아. And of course, one of my friends got pretty mad at me. Well anyway, my point is. It's pretty clear that most people are hooked on their smartphones.

Feedback 
This is a strong model answer for a difficult Q15 social issue question. It effectively uses the recommended structure: starting with a general issue (smartphone addiction) and then transitioning to a personal anecdote. The opening hesitation ('Wow issues. it's a really hard question 에바') sounds natural and buys time. The phrase 'I got say' is a good conversational opener. The transition to the personal story is smooth with 'Honestly, I'm no exception.' The anecdote about arguing with a friend during dinner is specific and relatable, using good phrases like 'way too much' and 'ended up arguing with a friend'. Detailing the phone activity ('scrolling through Instagram', 'replying to messages') adds realism. Conversational fillers ('you know', 'like', 'well') enhance fluency. The conclusion effectively summarizes the main point using alternative vocabulary ('hooked on' instead of 'addicted to') and phrases like 'my point is' and 'It's pretty clear that'. Overall, this answer demonstrates excellent command of vocabulary, structure, and conversational elements suitable for higher OPIc levels.
