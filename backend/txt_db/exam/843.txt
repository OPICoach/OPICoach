Question 
Can you describe some common issues and concerns people face while traveling or preparing for a trip? How do they handle these challenges?

Answer 
Well, I think language barriers are one of the biggest challenges when traveling abroad. I mean yeah it's really hard to communicate with locals, right? So yeah. I went to China last year. and sure enough. I ran into a problem. I don't speak a word of Chinese. Well, you know what? I went to restaurant and just pointed at a random dish. that looked good in the picture. and guess what? I still have no idea what I ate. So funny right? Uh anyway my point is. language barriers can be a real struggle. even with smartphone translators, you know

This model answer effectively addresses the Q15 travel issue question by focusing on language barriers. It follows the recommended structure: identifying a general problem (language barriers) and then providing a personal example. The opening clearly states the main point ('language barriers are one of the biggest challenges'). The conversational tag 'right?' engages the listener. The transition to the personal story about the China trip is clear ('So yeah. I went to China last year.'). The phrase 'sure enough' adds a natural storytelling element. Describing the problem ('I don't speak a word of Chinese') is impactful. The anecdote about ordering food in a restaurant is specific and memorable, using phrases like 'pointed at a random dish that looked good in the picture'. Engaging questions like 'you know what?' and 'and guess what?' build anticipation. The conclusion effectively restates the main point using different vocabulary ('real struggle' instead of 'challenges') and the phrase 'my point is'. Mentioning smartphone translators adds a touch of detail. This answer demonstrates good structure, vocabulary, and storytelling ability.
