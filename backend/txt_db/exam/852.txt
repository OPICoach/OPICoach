Question 
Now, tell me about the appointment you make. What kinds of appointments do you make in your daily life? Are they doctor's appointments or hair appointments? Tell me about what happens at your appointment.

Answer 
I make many kinds of appointments. For example, before seeing the doctor, I usually call the clinic or visit their website to make an appointment. These days most clinics or hair salons have their own website, so making appointments is very simple. I can make appointments really easily. What's more, I also make hair appointments. It's necessary to make an appointment for a haircut or perm because most hair salons don't accept walking customers. Also, I have to make an appointment through an email before meeting my professors for consulting. Lastly, I sometimes have get togethers with my friends. When I have dinner plans with them, one of us usually make a reservation at a restaurant. We have dinner and some drinks. And after that, we often go to a bar for a second round. To recap, I make different kinds of appointments such as doctor's appointments, hair appointments and so on.

Ensure parallel structure: 'call the clinic or visit their website' (not visiting). Use 'plan' for social gatherings with friends (e.g., dinner plans) instead of 'appointment'. 'Get together' is a good alternative for a social meeting. Use dynamic verbs like 'make' with 'appointments'. Reduce stress on the 'be' verb (e.g., 'making appointments is very simple'). Vary sentence patterns beyond just starting with 'I'. Use transition words like 'What's more', 'Also', 'Lastly', 'To recap' for better flow. 'Walking customers' is a good specific term. Use 'shop for' when talking about shopping for specific things. Use 'on' with websites (e.g., 'on this website'). Use 'hair stylist' or 'hair dresser' instead of 'hair designer'. 'And so on' is useful when you can't think of more examples. 'Doctor's appointment' is the standard phrase. Incorporate adverbs like 'pretty', 'really', 'so', 'quite' in spoken English. 'They' or 'them' can refer to businesses. 'Make phone calls' is a useful phrase. Using gerunds as subjects ('Visiting a website or making a phone call is...') adds variety.
