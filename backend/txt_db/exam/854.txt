Question 
Tell me about two of your close friends or family members. How are they similar? And how are they different? Tell me about what you commonly discuss with your family members or friends.

Answer 
You know I'm a pretty social person with a bunch of friends. And I'd like to talk about two of my besties I've been hanging out with lately. Okay then let me tell you about Chloe first. Yeah she's like my opposite which is pretty amazing considering how close we've become. You know she's super introverted. It took me a while to get used to her. Her go to things are binge watching Netflix or diving into books in her downtime. When she goes MIA, it's her way of recharging. Okay then there's David. He's super outgoing and always bursting with energy. So whenever he's got free time, he's hanging out with his buddies. I think that's where he gets his energy, just chatting with his friends. Yeah so Chloe and David are like not in day but man I adore them both. Well you know I'm on the job hunt. So obviously what my friends and I always talk about is our future plans. So we share common worries and concerns about our uncertainties. The job market has taken a hit since the pandemic. But Eva, I believe that everything will be fine if we do our best.
