Question 
Describe a breathtaking view you've seen.

Answer 
I still remember the breathtaking view of the mountain. It was a jaw dropping sunset. Having the barbecue dinner watching the sunset was an eye opening experience.

Feedback 
For AL level, use highly descriptive adjectives like breathtaking (extremely beautiful/impressive), jaw dropping (astonishing), and eye opening (revealing/surprising) to emphasize how impressive something was.
