Question 
Tell me about something you read or heard about recycling in the news.

Answer 
Wow. That's a really hard one. It's just something I've never really thought about. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, I don't know. Basically, I hardly read or watch the news these days because I've been very busy lately. So, I guess I have no idea about this. Yeah. Seriously, I don't know. Well, what I mean is, I can't think of any issues related to recycling. So, with that said, I would say I'll just have to move on to the next question.

Feedback 
This answer effectively uses a variety of fillers (Wow, Hmm, Yeah, I don't know, Basically, I guess, Seriously, What I mean is, With that said, I would say) to sound natural while navigating a difficult question. It demonstrates the ability to buy time, express uncertainty, explain the situation, clarify, and transition smoothly, which is a good strategy for high-difficulty OPIc questions.
