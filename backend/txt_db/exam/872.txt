Question 
Describe the clothes normally worn by people in your country. Do people wear different types of clothes for work and relaxing?

Answer 
Well, honestly, I'm not very interested in clothes and fashion trends. So, I can't say I know a lot about this topic, but I'll try my best to answer. So, when it comes to the clothes for work, I think it's usual for men to wear suits and women to wear suits or dresses at work. I guess people dress in a presentable way that is not messy or inappropriate. Oh, actually, depending on the office, casual shirts and pants are acceptable too. On the other hand, when people relax at home, they usually wear a t-shirt with sweatpants. You know, it's the best to be as comfortable as possible when you're at home, right? In addition, when people go out with their friends or on dates, the fashion styles vary a lot. Some people dress in very trendy clothes, other people will go out in casual attire even on dates. Well, in my country, I think it's normal for people to dress in trendy styles. I feel like people these days dress however they want, so the fashions are very diverse.

Feedback 
Excellent answer that directly addresses the question by describing typical fashion in your country and differentiating between clothes for work and relaxing/going out. You used a good range of vocabulary related to clothing and fashion, such as 'suits', 'dresses', 'sweatpants', 'presentable way', 'inappropriate', 'acceptable', 'casual attire', 'trendy clothes', and 'diverse'. The use of connecting phrases like 'When it comes to...', 'On the other hand', and 'In addition' helps create a smooth flow. Effective use of fillers like 'Well', 'Honestly', 'I guess', 'Oh, actually', and 'You know' makes the speech sound natural and conversational. The structure is clear, starting with an introduction acknowledging the topic, moving to specific examples for different situations, and concluding with a summary statement about diversity in fashion. Using phrases like 'I can't say I know a lot about this topic, but I'll try my best' and 'I feel like people these days...' adds a personal touch and complexity suitable for higher levels. The sentence structure, including comparisons like 'as comfortable as possible' and clauses like 'that is not messy or inappropriate', demonstrates good grammatical control. Overall, a well-organized and detailed response.
