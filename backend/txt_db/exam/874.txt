Question 
What is your favorite grocery store? Where is it? How often? And what? Why do you like?

Answer 
Jon Mart is my favorite grocery store. It is in Gangnam. It is very large and gorgeous. I feel happy when I go there. It has a wide range of ingredients. I'm satisfied with the previous purchase. I got a big discount.

This answer uses simple, single sentences with simple subjects. To improve, incorporate introductory phrases (e.g., 'Let me describe...', 'When it comes to location'), idiomatic expressions (e.g., 'Nothing beats...', 'real treat'), varied sentence structures (e.g., using 'it is apparent that...', gerund subjects), include more emotional expressions, and add a concluding question to the examiner (e.g., 'Eva, have you ever been there?'). Focus on using non-living subjects, combining topics, and using colloquialisms.
