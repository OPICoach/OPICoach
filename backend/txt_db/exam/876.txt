Answer 
On weekdays, my mom usually prepares meals and cleans the house. I often help my mom by setting the table and washing the dishes. My father does the laundry and takes out the garbage. I clean the bathroom on a regular basis. I'm in charge of feeding and walking the dogs. On Saturday morning, we go grocery shopping at a local market. On August 15th of the lunar calendar, we celebrate Chuseok, Korean Thanksgiving. It is one of the biggest traditional holidays of the year. Koreans celebrate Chuseok by making special foods such as rice cakes called Songpeon. When I was young, Chuseok was my favorite holiday because I got to see all my relatives. In the morning, we carry out a memorial service for our ancestors. Nowadays, it's a time when people take a break from their busy lives. I try to eat a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of vegetables and fruit. I avoid high calorie foods like pizzas and hamburgers. I try not to skip meals. I regularly go swimming after work. I work out at a gym at least three times a week. Yoga helps me sleep better at night. Anyway, these are the things that I do in order to stay healthy. I usually go to a bank during my lunch break. When you walk into the bank, the first thing you can see is ATMs. I usually use ATMs to deposit or withdraw some cash. The last time I went to the bank was two weeks ago. I went there to open a bank account. At that time, I had to wait for almost 20 minutes for my turn. I prefer online banking because it's much more convenient. I can transfer money, pay bills, and check my account balance. I usually take the subway when I go to work. It helps me get to my destination much faster than using cars or buses. There is a subway station close to my house. I take a subway because it is one of the most efficient ways to travel around the city. I avoid taking a bus during rush hours. Taxis in Korea are cheaper than in most other countries. Transportation has become a lot better over the years. I can get access to the internet whenever and wherever I am. I use my cell phone for almost everything. I do a variety of things like listening to music, watching YouTube, and reading ebooks. At work, I sometimes send important documents by email. In addition, I use my phone to take online classes. I like online classes because I can study at my own pace. There are more advantages of shopping online than shopping in a store. I can easily find up-to-date information on the internet. I bought a camera online and it was damaged during delivery. Yesterday, I accidentally dropped my phone in the water. I went to a service center to get it fixed. We gather regular garbage, food waste, and recyclable materials separately. I dispose of recyclable items in a designated bin. Some products like furniture and computers can only be recycled by paying a small fee.

Feedback 
Overall, your answer is excellent. You speak very fluently and cover a wide range of topics with good detail. Your grammar is mostly accurate, and you use appropriate vocabulary. You structure your sentences well. There are only a couple of very minor points: 1. In the sentence about the bank, 'the first thing you can see is ATMs' should be 'the first thing you see are ATMs' (using 'see' is more natural, and 'are' agrees with plural 'ATMs'). 2. 'get access to the internet' is correct, but 'access the internet' is a more common and concise way to say it. Keep up the great work!
