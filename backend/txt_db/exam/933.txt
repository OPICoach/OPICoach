Okay I remember a time when I got really upset at a restaurant. You know? Yeah I found a hair in my food. Okay so I'll just tell you what happened. All right a few days ago I was at a Chinese restaurant for lunch. Yeah it was like packed with people bustling with people crowded with people and I think it took more than half an hour for the food to be served. And okay here's what happened. You know? Well um when all the orders finally served you know I just started enjoying them but hey you know what? Oh man there was something really like long and curly in the food. You get it you know it was a hair gosh. as soon as I saw the hair you know yeah I talked to the manager at the restaurant. I was like excuse me there is a hair in my food. well actually the manager was pretty shameless because you know what? Yeah he told me they weren't responsible for the hair. he was like Well I'm sorry ma'am but we don't have a compensation policy for this kind of thing. you know I was so frustrated with their service that I just left the restaurant without finishing my meal. Yeah so since then you know I've decided not to go to that restaurant again.
