Question 
Describe the library you go to the most often. Where is it? How does it look like?

Answer 
No doubt. Hacker's library is my favorite place to study. When it comes to the library, it allows you to stay focused for a long time with the widest selection of books. It seems like the best attraction in Gangnam. The background music turns the place into cafe. For one thing, visitors will be banned from using laptops. It's quite different from other libraries in my country. Normally I stay there over two hours. There are fiction, non-fiction, something like that. There is no reason not to like the place.

Feedback 
To achieve AL, avoid simple sentences starting repeatedly with 'I'. Use varied sentence structures and subjects. Incorporate transition words and phrases like 'No doubt' and 'When it comes to'. Provide specific details and descriptive language (e.g., 'widest selection', 'best attraction', 'turns into cafe', location like Gangnam, duration like 'over two hours', specific rules like the laptop ban). Use idiomatic expressions ('something like that', 'There is no reason not to like'). Practice speaking with strong intonation and stress on key words. This descriptive approach can be adapted for other location descriptions (banks, hotels, parks).
