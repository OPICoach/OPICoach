Question 
Describe your most recent visit to the library. What did you do? Who did you go with?

Answer 
Going to the library with a cup of coffee is a real treat in my life. Last Sunday, my friends and I went to the library in Gangnam. I borrowed a book. Then it took my breath away. Plus, That's my stress reliever. These kind of books never fail to make me happy. Whenever I have a free time I go there. It's not far from my house. I'm totally hooked on it. All of a sudden I saw my kind of girl. It gave me butterflies. I got a crush on her. But nothing happened though. Anyway that's my story. That's life. Do you have this kind of memory 에바?

Feedback 
For experience questions, correctly using the past tense is crucial (e.g., 'went', 'borrowed', 'took', 'saw', 'gave', 'got'). Avoid using only the present tense, which limits your score (typically IH). Use complex sentence structures (e.g., 'Going to the library... is a real treat'). Include specific details (Last Sunday, Gangnam, borrowing a book, location relative to home). Incorporate idiomatic and expressive language ('real treat', 'took my breath away', 'stress reliever', 'never fail to make me happy', 'totally hooked on it', 'all of a sudden', 'my kind of girl', 'gave me butterflies', 'got a crush on her'). Speak naturally, like talking to a friend, using conversational fillers and questions ('Anyway that's my story', 'That's life', 'Do you have this kind of memory 에바?'). Don't be afraid to combine topics or add personal anecdotes (like seeing an ideal type).
