Feedback 
Use MBC (Main Idea, Body, Conclusion) structure for place description. State the cafe name clearly. Give 2-3 reasons why you like it. Reasons can include convenience, atmosphere, time-saving features (like app). For convenience, mention many locations ('every few blocks'). For atmosphere, use words like 'relaxing', 'comfortable', 'vibe', 'atmosphere' (pronunciation: atmosphere). Mention activities suitable for the atmosphere (studying, reading, chatting). For time-saving, mention using the app ('on the go', 'in just a few taps/clicks'). Use the pattern 'All you have to do is...' to describe picking up the order without waiting ('without standing in line'). Conclude by repeating it's your favorite/go-to cafe. When adapting for 'meeting friends', use the same reasons (convenience, atmosphere). Rephrase slightly ('everywhere in Korea', 'easily find one'). Use phrases suitable for meeting friends ('catching up', 'heart-to-heart chat'). Consider ending with a counter-question ('What about you...?'). Pronunciation tips: cafe (케페), comfortable (컴프터블), perfect (퍼펙트).
