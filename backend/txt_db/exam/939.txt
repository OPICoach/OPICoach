Question 
What do you usually do at a cafe? Who do you go with? What do you do there? (Survey: Cafe) --- I'd like to know what you usually do in your free time. Where do you go? What activities do you enjoy? (돌발: 여가 활동)

Answer 
Okay so, what do I usually do at a cafe, right? Let me think. Oh yeah, you know what? I guess it really depends on who I'm with. Okay so, when I go alone, well, I like to read a book or study with a nice cup of coffee. I don't know why, but it's such a great place for me to focus on my work. But when I'm there with friends, I usually just chat for a few hours. You know why? Time flies. Yeah, I think that's pretty much all I do at a cafe. That's it. --- (Adaptation for Free Time) All right, in my free time, I usually go to a cafe and spend some time there. So, when I go alone, I like to read a book or study. But when I'm there with friends, I usually just chat for a few hours. That's how I enjoy my free time.

Feedback 
For 'What do you do?' questions, a good structure is 'It depends on...'. Here, 'It really depends on who I'm with' (pronunciation: depends). Differentiate activities based on whether you are alone or with friends. When alone, mention reading, studying, focusing on work ('focus on my work'). Use the pattern 'It's such a great place for me to...'. When with friends, mention chatting ('just chat'). Add a phrase like 'Time flies' to emphasize enjoying the time. Conclude simply ('That's pretty much all', 'That's it'). When adapting for 'Free Time', state that going to a cafe is what you do in your free time ('spend some time there'). Reuse the 'alone vs. with friends' activities. Conclude by saying 'That's how I enjoy my free time'. Maintain present tense throughout.
