Question 
When and where do you usually use the internet? And what do you usually do there?

Answer 
You know, actually, I'm always online because, you know, I have a smartphone. And I'm actually a shopping lover. But my life is just too busy to go shopping in person. So I shop online these days. Well, it saves me a lot of time. So I just download a shopping app. And with a few taps, yeah, I can buy whatever I want. Yeah, I mean, it takes at least some an hour just to get to a shopping mall. But when I shop online, yeah, I don't have to waste time traveling. Yeah, that's pretty much what I do on the internet these days.

Great job applying and expanding the template for the internet question. Starting with 'I'm always online because I have a smartphone' is a direct answer. Adding personal details like 'I'm actually a shopping lover' and 'my life is just too busy to go shopping in person' makes the answer more specific and engaging. 'In person' is a useful phrase. 'It saves me a lot of time' is a good variation. 'With a few taps' and 'buy whatever I want' are well-integrated. 'That's pretty much what I do' is a natural-sounding closing phrase. Practice linking words and maintaining a consistent pace.
