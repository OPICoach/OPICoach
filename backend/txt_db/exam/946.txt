The lecture explains OPIc fillers, defining them as words or phrases used to mark pauses or hesitation. It categorizes fillers into three types: sounds (like 'um', 'uh'), phrases (like 'I think that', 'you know', 'kind of', 'at the end of the day', 'stuff like that', 'if you know what I mean'), and words (like 'well', 'okay', 'so', 'like', 'basically', 'actually', 'literally', 'seriously'). It advises against overusing filler sounds as it can suggest lack of confidence or knowledge, potentially lowering the score. Conversely, it strongly recommends using filler phrases and words strategically, especially varied ones, as they can improve fluency, make sentences sound more complete, and demonstrate higher proficiency, positively impacting the score, particularly for advanced levels like AL or IH. The speaker suggests planning which fillers to use for specific questions to ensure variety and naturalness. The example answer demonstrates the use of 'kind of' and 'you know' as filler phrases/words.
