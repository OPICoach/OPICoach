Question 
Describe your typical routine or activities when you have a staycation.

Answer 
Okay, uh, when I have a staycation, I usually, uh, just relax at home. I like to sleep in late, maybe until 10 or 11 am. Then I will, uh, eat breakfast late, like brunch. After that, I usually just watch TV or movies. Sometimes I read a book. In the afternoon, I might go for a walk near my home, like in the park. In the evening, I usually order food delivery or cook something simple. I don't like to do many things when I staycation. I just want to rest. It's a good time to recharge my energy. I think staycation is good because I don't need to travel far and it saves money. Yeah, that's my typical staycation.

Feedback 
Your answer addresses the question well by listing typical activities during a staycation. You use some good phrases like 'sleep in late' and 'recharge my energy'. To improve, try to reduce hesitation markers like 'uh'. Vary your vocabulary beyond 'just' (e.g., 'simply relax', 'enjoy watching'). Practice combining simple sentences to create more complex structures. For example, instead of 'I usually just watch TV or movies. Sometimes I read a book.', you could say 'After that, I usually spend time watching TV or movies, or sometimes I enjoy reading a book.' Also, be careful with the word 'staycation' when used as a verb; it's typically a noun. Saying 'when I staycation' should be 'when I have a staycation' or 'when I'm on a staycation'. Finally, adding a specific example (e.g., 'I watched the latest Marvel movie' or 'I read a novel by my favorite author') can make your answer more vivid and detailed, which is helpful for higher scores.
