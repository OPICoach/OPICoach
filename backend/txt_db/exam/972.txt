Feedback 
The teacher advises keeping questions simple (like WFC questions) and focusing on clear delivery. Start with an introduction like 'Hi, could you help me please?' and use a versatile phrase such as 'I have some questions about this t-shirt.' Example questions provided include: 'Could you help me find a larger size?' (after saying 'This is too small for me.'), 'Does this come in different colors? Can you please show me?', 'How much is it?', 'Can I get a discount with my credit card?', and 'Could you tell me where the fitting room is?'. The teacher also suggests adding phrases like 'oh one more thing' before the last question and paying attention to intonation (rising for yes/no questions, falling for Wh- questions). End with a thank you like 'Thank you so much for your kind answers. Bye.'
