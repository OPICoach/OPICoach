Feedback 
The provided text is a lecture by an OPIc instructor explaining how to answer this type of question. It does not contain specific feedback on a student's answer. The instructor suggests phrases like 'I'm not really happy with how it turned out', 'Would it be possible to fix it?', 'This isn't what I ordered', and 'Could you please help me with that?'. The instructor notes that explaining the exact issue (e.g., length) is not strictly necessary for IH and that simply stating the problem and asking for a resolution (fix or refund) is enough. Short answers are acceptable for problem-solving tasks (Q12).
