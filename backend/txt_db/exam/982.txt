Question 
I have a problem for you to solve. You're supposed to go on a business trip with your boss. But you can't make it due to a sudden matter. Call your boss and explain the situation and give two or three alternatives to the problem.

Answer 
Ring ring ring. Hello. Hi Mr. Lee. This is Jenna. How are you? Well, I'm all right. But actually, I have some bad news to share with you. Yes, it's about the upcoming business trip. The problem is I've been feeling very sick since last night. I've had a very bad headache and my throat really hurts too. So I'm thinking maybe I should go to see a doctor. Yes, I'm sorry. But I don't think I can make it to the trip tomorrow. I'm sorry. First of all, I was wondering, would it be possible to postpone our trip? I know we've been preparing for this trip for so long. If possible, could we go sometime next week? I'm sure I'll be feeling better by then. Or, if that's not an option, can someone else go instead of me? I was thinking of asking my team members since I've been working on this project with them. I could ask James because he knows about the trip. Oh okay, thank you so much. And again, I'm really sorry Mr. Lee. I'll see a doctor this afternoon and let you know. I'll call you back. I'm sorry. Bye.

Feedback 
This answer provides a detailed script for the roleplay scenario of cancelling a business trip with your boss due to sudden illness. The feedback emphasizes the importance of structuring the answer with an introduction (greeting, stating the reason for the call), explaining the problem (using phrases like 'I have some bad news', 'The problem is', and describing the symptoms using present perfect continuous like 'I've been feeling sick' and 'I've had a headache'), stating the inability to attend ('I don't think I can make it'), presenting two alternatives clearly (postponing the trip using 'Would it be possible to postpone?' and suggesting someone else go using 'Can someone else go instead of me?', linked with 'Or, if that's not an option'), and concluding with an apology and follow-up ('I'm really sorry', 'I'll see a doctor and let you know'). The feedback also suggests using filler words and connectors ('actually', 'Yes', 'First of all', 'I was wondering', 'If possible') and encourages practicing with expressive delivery (연기력) to sound natural rather than just reciting a memorized script. Using varied verb tenses and structures (like 'I've been feeling', 'I've had', 'Would it be possible', 'Could we go', 'Can someone else go') is highlighted as beneficial for higher scores. The phrase 'see a doctor' is recommended over 'go to the hospital' for general illness. The feedback notes that this structure and many phrases can be adapted for other cancellation scenarios.
