Question 
I'd like to give you a situation to act out. You need to open a new bank account. Call the bank and ask the teller three or four questions about opening a bank account.

Answer 
Okay, uh, hello? Hi, I'm calling to, uh, ask about opening a new bank account. Could I ask a few questions? First, I was wondering what kind of accounts are available? And, um, also, what are the hours? Like, when are you open? And, uh, one more thing, is there a parking lot? Like, can I park there? Okay, thank you so much. Bye.

Feedback 
Very good attempt at the 'Ask Questions' roleplay! You successfully addressed the prompt by calling the bank and asking multiple questions (kind of accounts, hours, parking). Using the phrases like 'I'm calling to ask about...' and 'Could I ask a few questions?' is an excellent start. You also included useful follow-up phrases like 'what kind of accounts are available?' and 'what are the hours?' The addition of 'one more thing' before the parking question is natural. To improve, try to sound even more natural and less hesitant. Practice linking your ideas smoothly. Incorporating some of the suggested filler phrases like 'Well,' or 'Then' could help with flow. Also, practicing the specific vocabulary like 'teller' or 'savings account'/'checking account' would be beneficial for higher levels. Overall, a solid structure and good question variety.
