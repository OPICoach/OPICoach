Hi [Friend's Name]. I heard you buy new MP3 player. How much it? Where you buy? Is it good? Tell me about it.

Feedback 
This answer is very basic and contains grammatical errors. For 'I heard you buy new MP3 player', 'buy' should be in the past tense, 'bought'. 'How much it?' is grammatically incorrect; it should be 'How much was it?' or 'How much did it cost?'. Similarly, 'Where you buy?' should be 'Where did you buy it?'. 'Is it good?' is grammatically correct but simple; consider 'Do you like it?' or 'How do you like it?'. 'Tell me about it' is a good phrase to ask for more details. To improve, focus on correct past tense verbs and question structures (e.g., using 'did' for past tense questions).
