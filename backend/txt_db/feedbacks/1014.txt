Feedback 
Call your family에 집중하세요. 질문을 너무 어렵게 끌어가지 마세요. 간단한 질문을 하세요. 인사와 목적을 포함하세요 (e.g., Hi mom, I want to invite...). Can I 대신 is it okay to, shall we, why don't we 등 다양한 표현을 사용하세요. 필러(well)를 사용하세요. 조잘조잘 모드로 이야기하세요 (e.g., Aaron told me...). 'second to none', 'beyond my expectations', 'far beyond my expectations' 같은 표현을 사용하세요. 'oh one more thing' 같은 전환구를 사용하세요. 상대방의 답을 가정하고 원맨쇼처럼 연기하세요. 전달력과 풍성함이 중요합니다. 질문만 나열하는 것보다 연기하는 것이 고득점에 유리합니다.
