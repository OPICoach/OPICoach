Question 
I'm sorry but there is a situation which I need you to resolve. You were planning to invite your friends to your house but one of your family members is sick. Call your friend and explain why you can't have them over and offer two or three other options.

Answer 
I am so sorry to tell you this at the last minute. I don't think you guys can come to my house today. The thing is my mom is not feeling well today. She got a cold. I can think of several options. Let's take a rain check. If not, why don't we go out to eat? I know a really good restaurant just down the street. Which option do you prefer? Do you have another option in mind? Okay I got it. Bye. To make it up to you I will buy you guys lunch. Thanks a million for understanding and I will make sure to invite you guys again as soon as possible. as soon as my mom gets better. Once again I am so sorry.

2단계는 문제가 생기는 유형입니다. 이유가 주어지지 않을 경우를 대비해 핑계 맞는 템을 준비하세요 (e.g., family gathering, car accident). 2-3가지 대안을 제시하세요. 'I am so sorry'는 전달력을 살려 말하세요. 'The thing is' 같은 표현을 사용하세요. 대안 제시 및 선호도 질문 맞는 템을 활용하세요: 'I can think of several options', 'Let's take a rain check' (미루자), 'If not'/'or', 'Why don't we', 'Which option do you prefer?', 'Do you have another option in mind?'. 지인에게 쓸 수 있는 맞는 템: 'To make it up to you I will buy you lunch'. 감사 표현 맞는 템: 'Thanks a million for understanding'. 재초대 맞는 템: 'I will make sure to invite you guys again as soon as possible / as soon as my mom gets better'. 'Once again I am so sorry'로 다시 사과하세요. 이유를 정확히 모르겠으면 'I have a problem' 등으로 돌려 말하세요. 전달력이 중요합니다. 생동감 있고 대화하듯이 말하세요. 3단계는 경험에 대한 질문이며 준비가 어렵습니다. 경험이 없으면 솔직하게 말하거나 비슷한 경험을 연결하세요. 전달력이 중요합니다.
