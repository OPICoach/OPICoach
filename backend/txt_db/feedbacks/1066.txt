Question 
The furniture in people's homes has changed over the years. Is the furniture in your current home different from what you had when you were young? Provide as many details as possible.

Answer 
Oh my gosh, so changes to the furniture, you know? Wow. I never really thought about that. Uh let me take a few seconds. You know why? Actually, when I was young, I didn't have a bed. You know, I shared the room with my sister. And there wasn't enough space for one. So I used to sleep on the floor without a mattress. Uh but now, um I'm all grown up and living alone in a studio apartment. Um you know what I did on moving day? Yep. I bought a bed. So my life has totally changed. It's so fluffy it makes me feel super relaxed. Okay, but here's the problem. Well, ever since I got my bed, like you know why? Uh I've become a total couch potato. I mean, I do almost everything in bed. um watch TV, read books, and more. Oh anyway, I got to say there have been quite a lot of changes to the furniture in my home since I was young.

Feedback 
This is a good approach to the 'Change/Comparison' question type, specifically comparing the past and present. You chose an easy comparison subject (bed) which is key. Your introduction effectively shows spontaneity and buys you time to think, using phrases like 'Oh my gosh' and 'Let me take a few seconds'. Remember to match your tone to this feeling. When talking about the past ('When I was young'), you correctly used past tenses ('didn't have', 'shared', 'wasn't'). Using 'used to' is also excellent for describing past habits or states ('used to sleep'). Pay attention to pronunciation for 'bed' (short vowel) and 'room' (avoid 'L' sound). The transition to the present ('but now') is clear and helps structure your answer. You correctly used 'I'm all grown up' and the term 'studio apartment' for 원룸. Engaging the listener with a question like 'You know what I did...?' adds a conversational feel. Using the present perfect ('has totally changed', 'have been changes') is appropriate for describing changes with present results. Adjectives like 'fluffy' add detail. The phrase 'makes me feel super relaxed' is well-used. Introducing a humorous example with 'Here's the problem' and the idiom 'couch potato' makes the answer engaging and personal. Ensure correct pronunciation of 'total' (not 'totally' here) and 'couch potato'. Ending a list with 'and more' is a natural, conversational touch. Your conclusion effectively summarizes the main point using 'Anyway' and 'I got to say' (a good casual alternative to 'I think'), reinforcing that changes have occurred since you were young. Overall, the structure, use of specific examples, and conversational elements are strong points for this question type.
