Question 
Please compare the past and present of a well-known business in your city. What has driven its growth? What is the biggest difference between then and now? I'd like to hear how this business has changed over time.

Answer 
Like I mentioned earlier, tourism is like probably the most promising industry these days. But, you know, in the past it wasn't that big. There weren't that many tourists like back then. However, as Korean movies and K-pop started getting attention, and more and more people started visiting Korea. At first, people were just interested in Korean movies and films, but now, you know, I've heard that a lot of people got into Korean culture as a whole. I find it fascinating that this industry has grown like so much in recent years.

Use transition phrases like "Like I mentioned earlier". Use vocabulary like "promising industry". Use phrases like "in the past" and "back then" (better than "at that time"). Practice using "started + -ing" (e.g., "started getting attention", "started visiting Korea"). Learn the phrase "get attention" (to become popular or noticed). Use the present perfect "I've heard that" or "based on what I've heard" to talk about information you've received over time. Learn the phrase "got into something" (to become interested in something). Practice using phrases like "I find it fascinating that" or "I find it interesting that" (higher level than "It's very interesting because"). Use the present perfect tense (e.g., "has grown") when talking about changes over time that continue to the present. Use adverbs like "so much" and time phrases like "in recent years".
