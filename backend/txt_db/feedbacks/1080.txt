Question 
Please tell me about the most memorable experience you've had in the park.

Answer 
Well, the most memorable experience in the park. Well, let me think about it. Um, I remember I lost my cell phone. Well, as I told you before, I usually go to the park for exercising. Well, on that day, I went to the park also with my sister for exercising. Um, uh, it was a few days ago, so, uh, it was a fall. The scenery was blended. Well, I mean the leaves turn to the red, yellow, green, and brown. Well, I mean the scenery was colorful. I really love the scenery. Anyway, uh, everything was perfect before I realized I lost my cell phone. So, after I realized that, I went back to the park with my sister, and I asked my sister to call my cell phone. Well, my cell phone started to ring at the bench. So, I ran to the bench, and I finally found my cell phone. I was real, I was really relieved because the cell phone is the one of the most important things to me. Well, anyway, uh, well, uh, it was the most memorable experience for me, but you know, I don't want to remember this experience again.

Feedback 
Overall, this is a strong answer that earned an IH score. Here's a breakdown of the feedback:

**Strengths (Why it earned IH):**
1.  **Natural Opening:** Starting with 'Well, let me think about it' and using fillers makes the response sound natural, like a conversation, avoiding the impression of a memorized script.
2.  **Accurate Past Tense:** The consistent and accurate use of past tense verbs (e.g., went, realized, lost, asked, started, ran, found, was) is crucial for OPIc experience questions and is a key high-score point.
3.  **Use of Fillers and Connectives:** Effective use of fillers like 'Well', 'Um', 'uh', 'you know' and connectives like 'So', 'Anyway' helps the answer flow smoothly and avoids awkward pauses.
4.  **Vocabulary (Adjectives & Phrases):** Good use of superlative adjectives ('the most memorable') and useful phrases like 'really relieved' and 'one of the most important things to me' adds depth and demonstrates a good command of English.
5.  **Adapting Template:** Successfully adapting a template (like the 'losing something' story) to a different topic (park) shows flexibility.

**Areas for Improvement (Towards AL):**
1.  **Vocabulary Variety:** To aim for AL, try to use more varied vocabulary and avoid repetition. For example:
    *   Replace the second 'exercising' with 'to work out'.
    *   Use 'splendid' instead of 'blended' for scenery description (vocabulary from other topics like geography or travel can be reused).
    *   Consider 'amazing' instead of 'colorful' to describe the scenery.
    *   Use 'unforgettable' or 'kind of unforgettable' instead of repeating 'memorable'.
2.  **Sentence Structure/Flow:** While generally good, some phrases could be smoother. For instance, rephrasing 'it was a fall' to better connect with the scenery description. Also, correcting 'turn to the red' to 'turned red and yellow' and removing the unnecessary 'the'.
3.  **Pronunciation/Fluency:** While not explicitly detailed in the text, the lecturer suggests de-emphasizing be-verbs (like 'was') to sound more fluent, which is a general tip for improving delivery.
4.  **Prepositions:** Although OPIc doesn't heavily penalize preposition errors, correct usage like 'on that day' is good. If unsure, blurring the pronunciation slightly can help.
