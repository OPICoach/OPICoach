Question 
Have you made any changes to your home? What were the changes that you made? Are you satisfied with the changes? Tell me everything in details.

Answer 
Okay, well, I feel like I need a second to think about it. Because honestly, I don't like making changes to my home. I guess I'm kind of lazy. Besides, I'm quite busy, so I don't have much time to stay home. Anyway, let me think about a change I made. So, to begin with, I'd like to briefly tell you about my home first. I live in a small apartment, and actually, it's a studio apartment. So, there's no separate bedroom. Basically, everything is combined into a single room, which means there is not much space. Also, I try to live a minimalist life, so I keep only the things I need. So, now I can think of one change I made to my home, to my place. Recently, about two months ago, I bought a new coffee table. I'd already had a table, but I didn't like its color. And honestly, it was too old. I purchased a new table from IKEA. And I put it by the window. It's a small table where I can drink coffee and enjoy the sun. It was about a hundred dollars. It was a good deal. It was a good buy. So, anyway, I love my place. Although it is such a small apartment, I've got everything I need. I'm very satisfied with my new table. I'm very happy with the new table.

This is a well-structured and detailed answer that directly addresses the prompt while incorporating natural-sounding fillers and varied vocabulary. The introduction effectively buys time and sets a realistic tone. Including a brief description of the home (even if not directly asked in this specific question) provides context and demonstrates the ability to connect ideas across potential related questions. The description of the change (buying a coffee table) is specific and easy to follow. Excellent use of past tense (bought, had, didn't like, was, purchased, put) and past perfect (had already had) demonstrates good grammatical control. The self-correction example ('it's too old' -> 'it was too old') is a great strategy for maintaining fluency and accuracy. Using phrases like 'which means', 'I try to live a minimalist life', 'keep only the things I need', 'think of one change I made', 'purchased', 'put it by the window', 'where I can drink coffee and enjoy the sun', 'it was a good deal/buy', 'Although it is such a small apartment', and 'I've got everything I need' adds sophistication and detail. Concluding with satisfaction about the change and the home provides a strong finish. Overall, this answer showcases strong speaking skills suitable for higher OPIc levels.
