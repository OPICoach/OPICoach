Question 
Clara, where do you like to meet your friends? Why do you prefer this place? Provide as many details as possible in your response.

Answer 
When I meet my friends, I usually go to Han River Park. There are several reasons for my preference. To start with, the park has breathtaking scenery. My friends and I can take many beautiful photos to upload to my Instagram. Oh, and Han River Park is within walking distance from my house. What's more, the park has convenience stores. So we can buy chicken, noodles and beer, and so on. Having chicken and beer is so delicious. These are the reasons why I prefer Han River Park to meet my friends.
