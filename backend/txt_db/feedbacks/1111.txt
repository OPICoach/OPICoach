Question 
N/A

Answer 
This is a good question because there are many beautiful beaches I like to go with my family.

Feedback 
Start with 'This is a good question' and give a reason. You can shorten the reason to 'because there are many beautiful beaches in my country'. Pay attention to the pronunciation of 'beaches' (long EA sound).
