Question 
N/A

Answer 
I guess we typically go a couple of times a year in the spring or in the fall.

Feedback 
Use 'I guess' as a connector. 'typically' means usually. 'a couple of times' means about two times. You can change the frequency (e.g., 'three to four times', 'several times') and the season.
