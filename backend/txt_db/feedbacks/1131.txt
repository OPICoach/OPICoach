Question 
Sam, my TOEIC score is 970 but my English speaking skill is deteriorated as I didn't use English for about 7 years. How should I study OPIc to get AL as soon as possible?

Answer 
Your TOEIC score suggests strong vocabulary and grammar, but OPIc is very different and focuses on speaking and communication skills. Getting AL depends on your current speaking level and how much time 'as soon as possible' means to you.

Feedback 
TOEIC and OPIc are very different. Many students with high TOEIC scores still get low OPIc levels. Improvement speed varies. An IM1 student might reach IH in about two months of intense study, but going from IH to AL for someone without overseas experience can take around eight months. Focus on speaking practice.
