Question 
It's hard to translate Hunger directly into English. How should I do?

Answer 
You need to practice more.

Feedback 
Directly translating Korean to English is difficult and often sounds awkward. You need more practice conversing in English with someone. It doesn't have to be a native speaker or a teacher; practicing with other students can be very helpful.
