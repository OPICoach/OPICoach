Question 
Sam, I want to get AL but I don't have confidence. So I always postpone my OPIc test. Should I try first?

Answer 
Taking the test once for the experience is recommended, as you learn a lot. However, it does cost money. If you're worried about the cost, you need to practice more.

Feedback 
Practicing alone can be difficult and boring. If possible, it's highly recommended to practice with others, like in a study group or community. If you practice alone, make sure to record yourself speaking a lot.
