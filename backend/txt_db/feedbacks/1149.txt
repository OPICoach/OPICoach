Question 
Sam, is it okay to say let me think or give me a sec when I have no idea?

Answer 
Of course.

Feedback 
It's perfectly fine to use phrases like 'Let me think', 'Give me a moment', 'Give me a sec', or '아 좀 생각해 볼게요' especially at the beginning of your answer when you need a moment to collect your thoughts. However, be careful with 'give me a sec' as it can be mispronounced. I recommend 'give me a moment' to avoid potential embarrassment.
