Question 
Sam, I lived abroad for about 3 years. So the OPIc test can I use that as experiences? I'm worried about maybe OPIc graders expect my English skills since I said I have abroad overseas experience.

Answer 
Yes, you can definitely use your experience living abroad. Don't worry about the graders' expectations.

Feedback 
It's okay to talk about your real experiences. Don't worry about what the graders might expect based on that. Honesty is the best policy. Use your experience if you have it.
