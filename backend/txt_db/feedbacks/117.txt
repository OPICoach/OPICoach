Question 
Tell me about your home.

Answer 
Oh, you want to know about my place? Well, you know, it's such a small place and um you know what? If you were to walk into my home, you wouldn't find it all that pleasurable. There's literally nothing.

Feedback 
'pleasurable'을 부정형('you wouldn't find it all that pleasurable')으로 사용하여 집이 작고 아무것도 없어서 '별로 즐겁지 않을 것'이라는 부정적인 감정을 표현합니다. 단어의 부정적 활용 예시입니다.
