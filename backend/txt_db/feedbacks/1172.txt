This answer takes the approach of saying you do focus on health. Key phrases and points: 'I find this question particularly interesting because...' is a good AL-level opening. 'eating right' is a good alternative to 'eat healthy food'. 'a variety of' is better than 'so many kinds of' (AL level). 'veggies' is a common conversational term for vegetables. 'nutritious meals', 'healthy dishes' are good alternatives. 'I find it rewarding' is a useful phrase. 'I think it's worth it' is a very important phrase for saying something is worthwhile, applicable to many topics. Connecting words like 'To tell you more', 'also' are crucial for fluency. 'look up' is important for searching information. 'decent' is a useful word meaning 'pretty good'. 'As for...' is essential for introducing sub-topics. 'health conscious' is a good AL-level adjective. Mentioning a personal experience (doctor's advice, gaining weight) adds detail but keep it concise in a description type question. 'hassle' is a very useful word for describing something troublesome (housework, recycling). 'stay energized' is a good phrase. Concluding phrases like 'in a nutshell' or 'to recap' are good for summarizing. 'grab' is a very common and useful verb for quickly getting something ('grab a coffee', 'grab a salad'). 'unwind' is a good AL word for relaxing. 'take a stroll' is an alternative to 'take a walk'. This answer uses richer vocabulary and sentence structures suitable for higher levels (IH/AL).
