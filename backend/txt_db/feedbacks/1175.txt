Question 
Please compare two parks that you know of. Tell me about any similarities or differences between parks.

Answer 
The speaker suggests comparing a small neighborhood park and the large Han River Park. The neighborhood park is described as peaceful, clean, with basic facilities (fountain, benches, exercise equipment), good for hanging out with friends or spending time with family. The Han River Park is described as huge, with a wide variety of facilities (camping, swimming pools, basketball courts, exercise equipment), long bike roads, and splendid scenery, making it great for outdoor activities in a busy city. The main differences highlighted are size and the variety/scale of facilities and activities available.
