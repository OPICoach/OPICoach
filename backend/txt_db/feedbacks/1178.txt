Feedback 
This is a roleplay question where you need to ask questions. A great tip is to remember the questions asked about *your* house in Q14 (e.g., Where do you live? What does it look like? How many rooms?). You can simply rephrase these questions and ask them about the other person's house. Add polite introductory phrases like 'I'd like to know about your house' and concluding phrases like 'Thank you for telling me that'.
