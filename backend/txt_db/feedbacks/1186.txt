Any question (using 'Well' as filler).

Answer 
Well, okay. / Well, let me tell you about... / Well, I don't know. / Well, I just haven't thought about this topic.

Feedback 
'Well' can also be used as a simple filler without much meaning, just like saying it casually before starting a sentence or expressing uncertainty.
