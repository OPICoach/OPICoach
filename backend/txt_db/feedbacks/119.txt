Question 
OPIc roleplay set question number 13, which is about past experience and explaining a problem (though the example is about a purchase).

Answer 
Well, um, you know what? Um, I I really like um clean my rooms. So I bought um, you know, uh Dyson vacuum cleaner.

Feedback 
The student's answer is relatively direct compared to an indirect style. It states the main point (liking a clean room led to buying a vacuum cleaner) fairly early. The extensive use of fillers ('Well, um, you know what?') makes the delivery sound very natural, which is beneficial in conversation tests like OPIc. Using fillers helps make the speech sound less stiff and more spontaneous, even if there are grammatical inaccuracies. For even better clarity and impact in OPIc, a more direct structure could be used, such as stating the purchase first ('I bought a Dyson vacuum cleaner') and then explaining the reason ('because I like my room clean'). However, the student's use of fillers successfully created a natural flow.
