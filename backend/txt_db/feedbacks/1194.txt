Question 
Let's start the interview now. Tell me a little bit about yourself.

Answer 
Hi, nice to meet you Eva. How are you? I'm pretty good, thank you. Well, to be honest, I'm a little bit nervous right now because it's an interview, but I'll try my best to answer all of your questions. My name is Jenna. Actually, my Korean name is Kim Jenna, but you can just call me Jenna. Do you like my name? I do because I think it's easy to pronounce. So, I guess I can tell you about what I do for fun. When I want to have some fun, I go out with friends and grab a coffee or a beer. I also like to go for a walk and spend time in nature. But honestly, I'm kind of a homebody these days because I'm staying home everyday because of the coronavirus. So I would say, what I like to do nowadays include listening to music and watching movies at home. Watching a movie while eating good food is something I love to do when I want to just chill. Um, I guess that's pretty much it for now, so I'll click the next button and move on to the next question.

Feedback 
This answer is a great example of how to approach the self-introduction question according to the video's advice. Instead of a typical list of facts (age, job, location), it focuses on a few specific, interesting points: the speaker's name and hobbies/what they do for fun. The language is conversational and natural, using phrases like "Well, to be honest," "I guess," "kind of a homebody," and "something I love to do when I want to just chill." It includes a warm greeting and a concluding remark about moving on, making it feel like a genuine interaction. Mentioning being nervous adds a touch of realism. The vocabulary is varied and appropriate for describing leisure activities (e.g., "grab a coffee or a beer," "spend time in nature," "listening to music," "watching movies"). This approach helps warm up for the interview and boosts confidence without sounding like a memorized script.
