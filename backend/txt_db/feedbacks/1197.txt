Question 
Tell me about something you read or watched about food contamination. For instance, food can get contaminated because of bacteria and it can become toxic. Describe an incident regarding this issue.

Answer 
Suggested strategies for this difficult question include: 1) Using '위기 탈출 대사' to state clearly that you haven't read or watched news about food contamination lately or can't think of any specific incident. 2) As an alternative, describing a personal experience related to food issues, such as getting food poisoning.

Feedback 
This is presented as a very difficult, unexpected topic (돌발 주제) that many people might not have specific knowledge or news to share about, even in their native language. The feedback highlights that it is perfectly acceptable and often necessary to use '위기 탈출 대사' to handle such questions. Phrases like 'I can't think of any issues related to this topic', 'I hardly read or watch the news these days', or 'I haven't watched or read the news about food contamination lately' are recommended. The key is to communicate effectively in English that you cannot answer the specific question as asked, rather than staying silent or struggling awkwardly. Offering a related personal experience (like food poisoning) is suggested as a valid alternative to demonstrate speaking ability.
