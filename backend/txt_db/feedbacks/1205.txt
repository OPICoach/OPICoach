Question 
Could you please tell me a little bit about yourself and your life?

Answer 
I live with my parents. My father works for the government. My wife works as a foreign language instructor. I live in an apartment. People walk along the riverside. It happened two years ago. My work is interesting. The park was crowded. My neighborhood is boring. While watching the movie, I was sad.

Feedback 
Thank you for your answer. Let's look at how you can improve. The most significant issue in your response is the extreme repetition of every sentence. In the OPIc test, repeating yourself like this severely impacts your score as it shows a lack of fluency and limited ability to expand on your ideas. You should aim to state each point once and then add more details or examples. Your sentences are grammatically correct but very simple. To achieve a higher score, try to use more complex sentence structures and connect your ideas. For instance, instead of just 'My father works for the government,' you could say 'My father has been working for the government for many years, which keeps him quite busy.' Also, try to elaborate on each topic. For example, regarding your neighborhood, you could explain *why* it's boring or what you wish was different. The flow between sentences is a bit disjointed; you jump between topics like family, housing, a park, and a movie without clear transitions. Try to group related ideas and use linking words. Finally, some statements are vague, like 'It happened two years ago' â€“ specify what 'it' refers to. Keep practicing speaking more fluently and adding detail!
