Feedback 
Your sentences are all grammatically correct and demonstrate a good understanding of various verb patterns, including those with direct and indirect objects ('show us how', 'buy family gifts', 'teach me how', 'give me a CD'), causative verbs ('made me feel happy', 'made the room brighter'), verbs of perception ('saw musicians perform'), and the verb 'help' ('helped mother cook', 'helped team win'). You correctly use structures like 'show someone how to do something', 'teach someone how to do something', 'make someone feel something', 'see someone do something', and 'help someone do something'. For an OPIc answer, you would want to connect these ideas more smoothly and provide more context or details for each point to create a cohesive response. For example, you could elaborate on *when* or *where* these events happened, or *how* they impacted you. However, the individual sentences themselves are well-formed.
