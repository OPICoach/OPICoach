Question 
Please tell me about your most memorable experience that you had when you used social media. What happened? Why was it so memorable to you?

Answer 
Sample answer based on Instagram (ChatGPT generated, discussed for content and phrases):
My most memorable experience with Instagram happened last year when I was planning a trip to Jeju Island. I wasn't sure which places to visit, so I searched for hashtags like #JejuIsland or #hiddengems. Through Instagram, I discovered some incredible spots, like a secluded beach and a small cafe with an amazing view, that weren't mentioned in the usual travel guides. What made it so memorable was that when I actually visited these places, they were even more beautiful than I imagined. And I ended up sharing my own photos on Instagram and some of my friends messaged me. This experience stood out because Instagram wasn't just about scrolling through pretty pictures; it showed me how social media can enhance real life adventures in unexpected ways.
