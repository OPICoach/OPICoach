Question 
Where and when do you listen to music? How often do you listen to music? Please describe everything in detail.

Answer 
I really like listening to music so I think it is such a good question. Actually I listen to music every morning and night. I mean I start my day by listening to some pop music to boost my energy. And before bed I often listen to classical music because it helps me fall asleep. So I'd have to say that I listen to music all the time. I think my home is the best place to listen to music. I like to just relax and chill out at home just listening to music. Sometimes I love to go to a concert or performance to enjoy live music. Speaking of which I often watch music videos and live concerts on YouTube. Anyway I think listening to music is a perfect way for me to spend my free time. Eva, how about you? Where do you listen to music and when do you listen to music?

This IH level answer effectively addresses all parts of the question (where, when, how often). The introduction uses 'I really like' and 'such a good question'. Body 1 details 'when' and 'how often' (every morning and night). It provides specific examples for morning (pop music to boost energy) and night (classical music to fall asleep), using phrases like 'I mean', 'start my day by ing', 'before bed', 'helps me fall asleep'. It summarizes frequency with 'I'd have to say that I listen to music all the time'. Body 2 details 'where' (at home, concerts/performances). It uses phrases like 'best place to', 'relax and chill out', 'love to go to a concert or performance to enjoy live music'. It includes a natural filler 'Speaking of which' to add related activities (watching music videos/concerts on YouTube). The conclusion uses a strong phrase 'perfect way for me to spend my free time' and demonstrates interaction by asking the interviewer a question ('Eva, how about you?'). The answer uses varied vocabulary and sentence structures to provide detail and flow.
