Question 
Tell me about your neighborhood.

Answer 
We talked about a dog that often barks in our neighborhood.

Feedback 
This sentence uses a relative clause ('that often barks') correctly. 'that' is appropriate for an animal. 'often barks' is a good descriptive phrase. 'neighborhood' is relevant vocabulary.
