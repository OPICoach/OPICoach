Question 
Tell me about a recent enjoyable experience you had, perhaps related to watching a movie, going to a concert, or visiting a park. Please describe what you did, who you were with, and how you felt.

Answer 
While watching the movie, I felt excited. I usually check the review before the movie. I went to a concert by my favorite singer. The concert was at a small venue. I like this place because it is near my house. I went to the concert with my friends. There are benches in the park. At the park, I like to relax on a park bench. When I go to the park, I usually bring something to read. I like going to the park with my friends.

Feedback 
Your answer contains several grammatically correct sentences and uses appropriate vocabulary like 'excited', 'venue', and 'relax'. You successfully describe different activities you enjoy (movies, concerts, parks) and mention details like who you were with and where the concert was. However, the answer jumps between these different topics without clear connections, making it feel a bit like a list of separate facts rather than a cohesive response about one or two related experiences. For example, you mention a movie, then a concert, then a park, without explaining how they relate or focusing on one in detail. In an OPIc test, try to focus on one main experience and use transition words to connect your ideas smoothly.
