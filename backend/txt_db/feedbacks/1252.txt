Question 
Tell me about your hobbies, interests, or any memorable experiences you've had recently.

Answer 
I go to the beach about three times a year. It's my favorite beach because it is so quiet and peaceful. At the beach, I usually sunbathe on the sand. I take extra clothing with me when I go to the beach. A problem I had while shopping was I could not decide what to buy. To solve the problem, I called the store and asked if they had my wallet. This experience made me feel embarrassed. The place I like to shop is a department store near Suwon station. I really enjoy watching Modern Family. I watch shows like this because they help me learn about new cultures.

Feedback 
Overall, your answer covers several topics which is good for showing range. Your sentences are mostly clear and easy to understand.

Specific Feedback:

1.  **Beach:** This part is well-described. 'Extra clothes' is slightly more common and natural-sounding than 'extra clothing' in this context, but 'clothing' is not incorrect.
2.  **Shopping:** There is a significant logical inconsistency here. You state the problem was 'could not decide what to buy,' but the solution you describe ('called the store and asked if they had my wallet') and the resulting feeling ('made me feel embarrassed') clearly refer to the problem of losing a wallet, not indecision about a purchase. In an OPIc response, it's important that your story flows logically and that the problem you introduce is the one you solve or discuss the outcome of.
3.  **TV Shows:** This section is good. Explaining *why* you watch shows like Modern Family (to learn about new cultures) adds depth to your answer.

Suggestions for Improvement:

*   Focus on ensuring coherence in your stories. If you describe a problem, make sure the solution or outcome you discuss directly relates to that specific problem.
*   Practice connecting your ideas smoothly so the listener can easily follow your narrative.
