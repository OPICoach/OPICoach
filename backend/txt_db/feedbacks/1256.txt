Feedback 
Your answer covers several topics: a memorable game, swimming, and biking. This shows you can talk about different experiences. However, the main feedback is the significant repetition of large parts of your answer. You repeat the sections about the memorable game, swimming, and biking entirely. In an OPIc test, repeating yourself like this is not ideal and can affect your score negatively. Try to present your ideas once and then elaborate on them if necessary, rather than repeating the same sentences or paragraphs. The individual sentences are generally understandable and grammatically correct, but the repetition makes the overall response less effective.
