Question 
I would like to know where you live. Can you describe your home to me? What does it look like? Blah blah blah. How many rooms does it have? Give me a description with lots of details.

Answer 
And it's like I feel like um more

Feedback 
This is an excellent example of a filler combination ('And it's like I feel like'). Using such fillers is characteristic of higher levels (AH/AL) and demonstrates natural conversational English.
