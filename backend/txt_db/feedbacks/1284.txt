Question 
In your background survey, you indicated that you enjoy listening to music. What kind of music do you like? Who is your favorite singer or composer?

Answer 
Student answer not provided in the text.

Feedback 
The feedback suggests starting broadly by saying you like all kinds of music (e.g., 'I love all kinds of music such as Hip hop, dance, jazz, you name it') and then narrowing down to a specific genre or artist if asked to pick one (e.g., 'but if I had to pick just one, it would be...'). This 'overall to specific' approach helps structure the answer and provides a natural flow. Suggested phrases include 'you name it', 'if I had to pick just one, it would be...', and 'It's not really easy for me to just choose one, but let's just focus on...'. Emphasis is placed on using filler words and speaking naturally.
