Question 
Describe one of your family members or friends. What does he or she look like? What is special about the person? Give as many details about this person as you can.

Answer 
Oh, all right. One of my family members or friends? Hmm, let me see. Okay. I'd like to talk about one of my best friends, Jenny. So, speaking of her appearance, I think she's very pretty. Jenny has an oval face and big brown eyes. And maybe that's why she's so photogenic. Also, I feel like her outfits are always so cute. I mean, she's really fashionable. So, I like to take her when I go shopping for clothes. What else? Um, oh, you know what? Jenny is a person who always tries to have a healthy lifestyle. Seriously? She likes to eat healthy and drinks a lot of water. I'm impressed with her lifestyle, especially with her diet. She keeps a balanced diet with lots of fruits and vegetables. And sometimes we go out to eat at a healthy salad bar. Well, anyway, I have to say Jenny is my good friend. We have a lot in common. I mean, we share interests like music and movies too. I feel like there's more to say about her, but I'll wrap it up here. I'm grateful I have a good friend like Jenny.

Feedback 
This is a well-structured answer template for describing a friend or family member, adaptable for other 'person description' topics like a healthy person, favorite singer, or actor. Good use of an introductory reaction ('Oh, all right? Hmm, let me see.'), a clear topic sentence ('I'd like to talk about...'), body paragraphs covering appearance/fashion and lifestyle, and a concluding statement. Key phrases and vocabulary used effectively include: 'Speaking of...', 'oval face', 'big brown eyes', 'photogenic', 'outfits are always so cute', 'fashionable', 'shop for clothes', 'What else? Um, oh, you know what?', 'tries to have a healthy lifestyle', 'Seriously?', 'likes to eat healthy', 'drinks a lot of water', 'I'm impressed with her lifestyle', 'keeps a balanced diet', 'lots of fruits and vegetables', 'go out to eat at a healthy salad bar', 'Well, anyway,', 'I have to say', 'We have a lot in common', 'I mean,', 'share interests', 'I feel like there's more to say, but I'll wrap it up here', and 'I'm grateful I have...'. The use of fillers ('Um', 'I mean,', 'Well, anyway,') and expressions showing thought ('Hmm, let me see.', 'What else?') helps create a natural, conversational flow. Varying speed and adding emotion are recommended for higher scores. The structure (intro, body, conclusion) helps organize thoughts. This template can be modified to describe other people by changing details about appearance, habits (like adding exercise), and shared interests. Practicing the answer out loud, perhaps even starting in Korean, is crucial for natural delivery.
