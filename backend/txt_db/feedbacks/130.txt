And so, for that, I am preparing um, you know, how to shot, uh how to give a shot, um with no pain. because I think that's uh the most important thing. Um, of course, uh to be a nurse, I mean, um, to work as a nurse, uh, I need to prepare a lot of thing, right? Um, first, you know, I need to write a lot of resumes and uh when the once the resume uh has passed, I need to uh prepare um for the interviews, right? Um, but I think, you know, the uh the most important skill that I I have to have is that um, you know, how to shot um with no pain, right? Because, you know, thinking about a nurse, um, the first thing um, in my mind is that shot, right? I think, um, you think the same. And so, um, uh, back when I was a student, I didn't think like that, but um, I heard a lot of things to things from professors and so I realized that um, a good nurse should um, should have a good skill. And so, yeah, um, I want to be a good nurse. That's my, you know, goal.

The answer starts well with 'Currently, I have a nursing license,' which is a confident S part. The use of 'And so' is good for conversational flow, making it sound natural and unscripted, which is better than overuse of 'so'. The phrase 'looking for a job to a hospital' is slightly awkward; 'at a hospital' or 'I want to work for a hospital' would be more natural. The speaker explains the subtle difference between 'work at' and 'work for'. The student initially said 'how to shot' but corrected to 'how to give a shot', which is a good self-correction technique by repeating 'how to'. While 'how to administer a shot' is a more advanced option, simple words are fine for the S part. 'with no pain' is good; alternatives like 'a painless shot' or 'pain-free' are also suggested. The connection 'because I think that's the most important thing' clearly links the importance to the skill. The transition to the M part, 'Of course, to be a nurse, I mean, to work as a nurse...', is good, showing effort to cover other necessary preparations. There is a grammatical error in 'a lot of thing'; it should be 'a lot of things' (plural). The speaker recommends 'a lot of' over 'lots of' or 'tons of' (often used in scripts). The use of 'right?' as a conversational tag is effective, making it sound like talking to Eva and providing thinking time. Using 'First' is acceptable here as it's not part of a rigid list (first, second, third). 'a lot of resumes' is correct. The transition 'And once the resume has passed' is good, but 'has passed' is slightly awkward; 'once I pass the resume process' or 'after that' are suggested. 'prepare for the interviews' is perfect English. The transition to the A part using 'But I think the most important skill...' is very effective for introducing the main point/opinion. The speaker emphasizes the importance of 'but' for smooth transitions, contrasting it with 'however' used at the start (scripted) vs. in the middle (okay), and mentioning 'though' as an advanced option. The phrasing 'skill that I I have to have is that' is awkward; 'the most important skill is' or 'the most important skill that I need is' are better. The student repeats the 'how to shot' error but corrects again to 'how to give a shot' or 'how to give a needle shot'. Explaining the reasoning 'Because, you know, thinking about a nurse, the first thing in my mind is that shot, right?' is clear. 'I think, um, you think the same' is awkward; 'I'm pretty sure you think the same' or 'I'm sure you agree (with me)' are better. The R part uses a good quick comparison strategy: 'back when I was a student, I didn't think like that, but I heard a lot of things from professors'. 'heard a lot of things to things' is slightly awkward; 'heard/learned a lot of things' is better. 'a good nurse should have a good skill' is a bit vague; specifying the skill (e.g., 'skills in giving good needle shots') would be more detailed. The T part conclusion 'And so, yeah, I want to be a good nurse. That's my, you know, goal.' is simple and clear. The answer was 1 minute 57 seconds, close to the 2-minute limit but acceptable, especially given the difficulty. Despite minor errors and awkwardness, the answer effectively uses the SMART structure and conversational elements, making it a high-level (AL) response.
