Question 
Have you ever experienced any problems at a bank? For instance, sometimes ATMs malfunction. So what sort of problem did you face and how did you deal with it?

Answer 
Well, as I mentioned earlier, you know, I don't really go to banks these days, right? So I'm basically, you know, I haven't had any issues there. I haven't had any problems there. All right. If I do, I'll keep you updated. Okay?

Strategy for difficult/irrelevant 돌발 questions: Give a short, honest answer. Key expressions: 'as I mentioned earlier', 'I don't really go to banks these days', 'I haven't had any issues there', 'I haven't had any problems there', 'I'll keep you updated'. Use fillers like 'Well', 'you know', 'right?', 'So', 'basically', 'All right', 'Okay?'. Focus on fluency and natural delivery even with a short answer.
