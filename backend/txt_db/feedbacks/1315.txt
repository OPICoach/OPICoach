Question 
Describe the banks in your city. Where are they usually located? And what are they like? What hours are banks typically open there?

Answer 
I think like other countries, there are so many different brands of banks in Korea. I mainly use 땡땡땡 bank because this bank has the most branches nationwide. It's super convenient when I want to withdraw some cash. The bank opens from 9 to 4, right? But as far as I know, some branches open till 6. This bank offers customer friendly services. So I love this bank.

Feedback 
This answer effectively describes banks in general and a specific bank used. Key phrases like 'I think' and 'as far as I know' serve as good fillers for natural conversation. 'So many' is used for emphasis. 'Mainly use' indicates preference. 'Most branches nationwide' is a strong point for convenience. 'Super convenient' is a useful expression. 'Withdraw' is the correct term for 출금하다. 'As far as I know' indicates the limit of one's knowledge. 'Customer friendly services' describes the quality of service. Using fillers and specific vocabulary enhances delivery and score.
