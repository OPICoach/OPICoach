Question 
Tell me about the relationship between your country and neighboring countries.

Answer 
Um, this is a very difficult question and I haven't thought about this, but I'll try my best to answer. I'd like to talk about the relationship between Korea and China. There have been a lot of changes in the relationship between the two countries. For example, in the past, there was not much interaction between the two countries. Thus, there were not many Chinese tourists in Korea. Oh, and as far as I know, Korean music was not popular in China. But nowadays, it's totally different. Korean pop songs and singers are all the rage in China. As a result, there is more interaction between the two countries. I mean, many Chinese people are visiting Korea. And tourism industry is getting bigger day by day. I personally think that this is the biggest change between Korea and China.

Strategy: Approach with an easy topic (e.g., K-pop, not politics) and keep the answer short (around 30 seconds). A personal example is optional. Key Phrases/Patterns: Use the 'magic sentence' ('Um, this is a very difficult question...') for difficult questions. Use 'There have been a lot of changes in...' to discuss changes. Use 'In the past...' and 'But nowadays...' for comparison. Incorporate fillers like 'As far as I know,' 'I mean,' and 'I personally think that.' Use expressions like 'all the rage' (대유행) and 'day by day' (날이 갈수록). Grammar/Pronunciation: Ensure correct use of past tense when describing past events. Practice intonation, especially for phrases like 'in the past.' General Tips: Focus on clear delivery and a simple storyline. Practice speaking the phrases aloud for natural flow. It's acceptable if you don't provide a perfect conclusion; focus on overall coherence.
