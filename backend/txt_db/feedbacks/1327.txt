Question 
Tell me about some issues or concerns related to [Topic].

Answer 
Eva, I can't think of any issues related to this topic. Actually, I don't have much time to watch the news these days because I've been busy lately. And honestly, I haven't thought about this topic at all, at all. Well, I really have no idea, so can I just skip this question?

Feedback 
This is a strategic and effective way to handle a difficult issue question when you genuinely don't know the answer, especially for higher OPIc levels (IH, AL). Instead of staying silent or giving a very short, awkward response, you are demonstrating fluency and conversational management skills. You are admitting you don't know, providing a plausible reason (being busy), and politely asking Eva if you can skip the question. This shows you can communicate naturally even when faced with an unexpected challenge. Practicing the delivery of these lines with natural intonation is key.
