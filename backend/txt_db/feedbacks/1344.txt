Question 
Have you ever had any problems with your furniture? Perhaps it could have gotten damaged for some reason. Tell me what exactly happened and how you dealt with the problem in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
Well, I live in a dorm. So I don't have many pieces of furniture, you know? They're just some old furniture items. So there haven't been any problems with the furniture. By the way, if it's okay, I've had some problems with my room appliance. So if you don't mind, can I talk about that? Um recently, the really old TV in my dorm dorm room like broke down, you know? A few years ago, I bought a new bed because my old one was too old and uncomfortable. Um I think there was an issue with the mattress, you know? Whenever I moved in bed, it made some like creaking noise. It was really uncomfortable to sleep and even caused some back pain. So I went to IKEA, you know? IKEA has a website but I wanted to see, I wanted to see the actual products and I found a mattress that I really liked there. Um the items were a bit more expensive than I had thought, but I couldn't live without a new mattress. So I bought a new mattress with a new bed frame. You know, the mattress is like incredibly comfortable and the design of the bed frame is like pretty nice. Um, you know what? I really love them, right?

This answer addresses a problem related to furniture (a mattress) or a related home item (TV), demonstrating the ability to handle problem/experience questions. Key strategies include: 1. Acknowledging the lack of furniture problems and asking to talk about a related issue (`I live in a dorm... So there haven't been any problems with the furniture. By the way, if it's okay, I've had some problems with my room appliance. So if you don't mind, can I talk about that?`). This is a good way to handle questions where you genuinely don't have a direct experience. 2. Using past tense consistently to narrate the problem and solution (`broke down`, `bought`, `was`, `had`, `made`, `was`, `caused`, `went`, `wanted to see`, `found`, `were`, `had thought`, `couldn't live`, `bought`). 3. Using specific vocabulary to describe the problem and solution (`broke down`, `issue with the mattress`, `creaking noise`, `uncomfortable to sleep`, `back pain`, `actual products`, `incredibly comfortable`, `pretty nice`). 4. Using transition words and fillers (`By the way`, `if it's okay`, `if you don't mind`, `Um`, `you know`, `So`, `like`, `well`, `you know what`). 5. Describing the problem, the action taken (`went to IKEA`, `bought a new mattress`), and the result. The bad example was off-topic, discussing a TV (appliance) instead of furniture, although the good example also mentions a TV as a possible alternative topic if no furniture problem exists. Vocabulary from bad example: `broke down`, `ended up buying`, `used TV`, `Karrot Market`, `There is probably something similar in the USA too`, `pretty decent`, `made a good purchase`. Vocabulary from good example: `pieces of furniture`, `old furniture items`, `haven't been any problems with`, `by the way`, `if it's okay`, `room appliance`, `if you don't mind`, `talk about that`, `broke down`, `issue with the mattress`, `whenever I moved`, `creaking noise`, `uncomfortable to sleep`, `caused some back pain`, `went to IKEA`, `actual products`, `found a mattress`, `items were a bit more expensive than I had thought`, `couldn't live without`, `bought a new mattress with a new bed frame`, `incredibly comfortable`, `design is pretty nice`, `I really love them`. Also, important phrases for handling questions where you don't have a direct answer or have already answered: `I already told you about...`, `I'm sorry but I don't have any more stories to share`, `Sorry, I don't think I can answer this question Eva. Sorry.`.
