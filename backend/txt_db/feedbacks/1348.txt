Question 
You indicated that you like to go to parks. Please describe the park you often go to. What does it look like? Where is it located? Are there any special things about the park? Does it have any special facilities? Please tell me everything about your favorite park.

Answer 
I live in a suburb called [Your Suburb Name]. What makes my neighborhood special is the small park near my house. It's absolutely beautiful and the perfect place to spend free time. It's pretty close to my place, taking only 10 minutes to get there on foot. As you walk into the park, the first thing you see is a lot of beautiful flowers. In the spring, it's scenic with lots of cherry blossoms. In addition, in the middle of the park, there is a small lake. By the lake, there are picnic tables where people can enjoy picnics. What's more, this park has great facilities like a soccer field and some exercise equipment. There's even a small snack bar and food trucks. So, I sometimes like to drop by one of the food trucks and grab a bite to eat or drink after taking a walk. I think this park is the best place in my neighborhood.

Feedback 
Start naturally with fillers like 'well, you know, right'. Avoid stiff openings like 'I live in a suburb...'. Use strong adjectives like 'absolutely beautiful'. Connect ideas smoothly ('so you know'). Use correct phrases like 'on foot' (not 'by walk'). Use descriptive language ('scenic'). Employ conjunctions and connectors ('as you walk into', 'in addition', 'what's more') to structure your response and achieve higher levels (IH+). Use contractions ('there's' instead of 'there is'). Vary vocabulary ('by the lake' instead of just 'next to'). Mention specific facilities. Use useful phrases like 'drop by/stop by' and 'grab a bite to eat'. Conclude naturally, perhaps with a 'so' before the final sentence. Focus on patterns and natural delivery over just memorizing fancy expressions. This template can be adapted for describing other locations like libraries or concert halls.
