Question 
I would like to know how people dress in your country. What kinds of clothes do they wear for work or leisure?

Answer 
묘사, habit, 비교

Feedback 
This is a Description question (묘사). Although 'do' is present, it asks for a description of the clothes worn for work or leisure, not what actions people do while dressing. 'What kinds of clothes do they wear' is important. The options 'work or leisure' are given to make it easier, not to ask for a comparison. You only need to choose one option to talk about. Higher difficulty questions give more options/examples.
