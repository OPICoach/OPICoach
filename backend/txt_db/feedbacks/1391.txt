Question 
You indicated in the survey that you listen to music. Tell me about how your interest in music changed from the past till now. 설문 조사에서 음악을 듣는다고 응답하셨습니다. 과거부터 지금까지 음악에 대한 관심이 어떻게 변했는지 말해 주세요.

Answer 
My interest in music has changed over time. In the past, I mostly listened to pop music and idol groups. As I grew older, I started exploring different genres like rock, indie, and hip-hop. I also became more interested in the lyrics and the message of the songs. Nowadays, I enjoy discovering new artists and listening to music from different cultures.

Feedback 
You clearly explain the evolution of your music interest. The use of time markers like 'over time,' 'In the past,' 'As I grew older,' and 'Nowadays' helps structure your narrative effectively. You use good vocabulary related to music genres ('pop music,' 'idol groups,' 'rock,' 'indie,' 'hip-hop'). The sentence 'I also became more interested in the lyrics and the message of the songs' shows good complexity. The answer is coherent and easy to follow.
