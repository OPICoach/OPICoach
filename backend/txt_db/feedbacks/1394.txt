Question 
How were cafes and coffee houses like in your childhood? Were they really popular? Describe what you remember in detail. 어렸을 때 카페와 커피 하우스는 어땠나요? 정말 인기가 많았나요? 기억나는 것을 자세히 설명해 주세요.

Answer 
In my childhood, cafes and coffee houses were not as popular as they are today. They were mostly seen as places for adults to have coffee and talk. There weren't as many options as there are now. I remember some small, traditional tea houses or cafes, but they weren't places where young people would hang out. The coffee culture has definitely grown significantly since then.

Feedback 
You effectively contrast the past and present state of cafes. You directly answer whether they were popular ('not as popular'). You use comparative structures ('not as popular as they are today,' 'weren't as many options as there are now') correctly. Vocabulary like 'traditional tea houses' and 'coffee culture' is appropriate. The concluding sentence summarizing the change is strong ('grown significantly since then').
