Question 
Now, let's talk about your bedroom. What's inside? What kind of furniture do you have in your room? 이제 침실에 대해 이야기해 봅시다. 안에는 무엇이 있나요? 방에 어떤 종류의 가구가 있나요?

Answer 
In my bedroom, I have a bed, a desk, a chair, and a wardrobe. I also have a bookshelf filled with books and some decorative items on the walls. The furniture is mostly simple and functional. I have a bedside table with a lamp and an alarm clock. My room is not very big, but it's comfortable and organized.

Feedback 
You provide a clear list of the main furniture items in your room. You add detail about the bookshelf and decorative items. Describing the furniture as 'simple and functional' and the room as 'comfortable and organized' adds good descriptive language. The sentence structure is straightforward and easy to understand. Good use of 'mostly' and 'also'.
