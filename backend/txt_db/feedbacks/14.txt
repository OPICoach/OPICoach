Question 
Tell me about a memorable experience you had while eating something. It could have been good or bad. What happened? Why was it memorable or special? Tell me everything in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
Let me tell you about my memorable experience while eating something. This year I remember when I ate my birthday cake. So I really loved that cake. Because my girlfriend made the cake herself.

Feedback 
'Let me tell you about my memorable experience while eating something' feels robotic; break it down and start slowly (e.g., 'Let me tell you about this one experience, right? Okay. Well, this is what happened.'). Starting slowly helps avoid sounding scripted. Instead of 'This year I remember when I ate my birthday cake', be more direct: 'This year on my birthday I had [type of] birthday cake'. Add adjectives like best, amazing, wonderful, delicious, sweet. 'So I really loved that cake' is a very good sentence for beginners. 'Because my girlfriend made the cake herself' is good; alternatives include 'made me that cake herself', 'made it herself', 'made it all by herself' (meaning completely alone). Use the root word strategy: if you used 'love', use 'lovely' in the body (e.g., 'When I took my first bite... It was lovely'). Combine 'lovely' with adverbs like so, absolutely. Use the root word strategy when you are blanking out or don't know what to say next.
