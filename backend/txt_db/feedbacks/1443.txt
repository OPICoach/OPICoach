Question 
Please explain your most memorable local festival. What made it so memorable? Why was it so special? Were there any special activities or events that took place?

Answer 
Let me tell you about the Fireworks Festival I went to. I went with friends, and when we got there, it was packed with people. I thought we shouldn't have been there, but we found a decent spot, put down a mat, and just kicked back and relaxed while chatting. The weather was good, and the view was really gorgeous, absolutely amazing. The crispy air was nice too. Plus, my friend brought homemade gimbap which was way tastier than I expected. When the fireworks started, I was totally amazed, truly astonished. I couldn't take my eyes off those breathtaking fireworks. We were so impressed. It was seriously one heck of a show. It was truly scenic. I definitely want to go again next year.

Feedback 
When describing a past experience, consistently use the past tense ('went', 'got', 'was packed', 'thought', 'shouldn't have been there', 'found', 'put', 'kicked back', 'relaxed', 'brought', 'was', 'started', 'was amazed', 'couldn't take', 'were impressed'). Use adjectives to describe feelings ('amazed', 'astonished', 'impressed') and sights/experiences ('packed', 'decent', 'gorgeous', 'amazing', 'crispy', 'tastier', 'breathtaking', 'impressive', 'scenic', 'one heck of a show'). Use adverbs like 'totally', 'truly', 'absolutely', 'way' to add emphasis. Use linking words like 'Plus'. Describe the sequence of events and your reactions. Ensure your intonation conveys emotion and naturalness.
