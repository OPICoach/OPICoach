Question 
Is there a particular store you visit a lot? Describe the store in as much detail as possible.

However, my favorite shopping center is Hacker's Shopping. I can buy my shirts, shoes, and uh jackets. The shopping mall is really big. It's really famous and cheap.

Feedback 
문장 시작을 I로 굉장히 많이 하고 단문을 많이 쓰는 경우 IH가 많이 나옵니다. 문장 자체가 굉장히 단문이 많을 경우 점수를 조금 더 많이 받기가 힘듭니다. (단문: My favorite shopping center is hackers. I like coffee. I like shopping. The shopping mall is big.)
