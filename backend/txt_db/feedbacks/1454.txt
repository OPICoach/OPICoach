Question 
I'm going to give you a situation to act out. There is a new restaurant close to your home and you want to go there with your friend. Call your friend and ask him or her to visit with you and figure out details.

Answer 
Hello? Hi, how are you? Good. I'm good too. I just finished work. What are you doing tonight? Would you like to get something to eat with me? Oh, you're busy tonight? What about tomorrow? Yeah? Okay. There's a new place that's close to my house that I would love to try. Would you like to do that? Yeah? Okay. What would you like to wear? Pretty dress? All right, me too. I'll wear the same. All right. Sounds good. I'll see you then. Bye. Pretty dress.

Feedback 
The participant felt the answer was "very awkward" and did "not sound natural at all" for talking to a friend. The discussion highlighted that phrases like "Would you like to get something to eat with me?", "Would you like to do that?", and "What would you like to wear?" felt too formal for a casual conversation. The participant noted they would normally be more "relaxed" and use phrases like "Hey, how's it going?"
