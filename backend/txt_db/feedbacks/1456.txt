Question 
Have you ever experienced any problems with your home appliance?

Answer 
[Based on the speaker's description of a typical IH answer]: The answer uses the present tense to describe a past experience. For example, instead of saying 'My laptop didn't work', it would use present tense like 'My laptop doesn't work'.

Feedback 
When asked about past experiences, you absolutely must use the past tense. Eva is very particular about tense usage in these questions. Using only the present tense for a past event makes it difficult to even reach the IH level. You need to change the tense to past tense to accurately describe the experience.
