Question 
Tell me about a cafe you often visit. Where is it located? What does it look like?

Answer 
Oh, you know, as a coffee lover, um, I can come up with quite a lot of quality cafes I've been to. Well, it's pretty hard to choose. But, well, let me tell you about this cafe named um hackers. Well, the best part about this place is um the reasonable prices. Oh, you know what? It's just a dollar for a coffee. It's a steal, right? Well, um, as a student, I personally think that um spending more than $3 for a cup of coffee is uh too much. On top of that, um it has a cozy and comfortable atmosphere for me to relax and have a heart to heart chat with my friends. Hey, do you like coffee? Well, let's go grab some.

Feedback 
The question asks about a cafe you often visit, its location, and appearance. The answer structure follows MBC. Main Idea: Start with fillers like 'Oh, you know' and an expression like 'as a coffee lover'. Use 'I can come up with' (paraphrase of 'I can think of') to say many cafes come to mind. Mention 'quite a lot of quality cafes I've been to'. Add a phrase like 'It's pretty hard to choose' if you want to sound natural. Choose one using 'Well, let me tell you about this cafe named hackers'. Body: Give reasons. Use the pattern 'The best part about this place is...' (paraphrase of 'What I like most about...'). Reason 1: Price. Mention 'the reasonable prices'. Give a specific detail: 'It's just a dollar for a coffee'. Use the expression 'It's a steal' (means very cheap, a bargain). Add personal context: 'as a student'. Use 'I personally think that' for your opinion. Give a specific opinion, e.g., 'spending more than $3 for a cup of coffee is too much'. Reason 2: Atmosphere. Use a transition like 'On top of that'. Describe the atmosphere: 'It has a cozy and comfortable atmosphere'. Atmosphere pronunciation: 'atmosphere'. Can also use 'vibe'. Comfortable pronunciation: 'comfortable' or 'comfy'. Explain what you do there: 'for me to relax and have a chat' or 'have a heart to heart chat' (deep conversation) 'with my friends'. Conclusion: Suggest going together. Ask 'Do you like coffee?'. Suggest going: 'Let's go grab some' (grab some means get/drink some coffee).
