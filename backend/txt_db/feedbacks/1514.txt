Question 
How has the relationship between your country and neighboring countries changed? What is the reason for that change?

Answer 
The relationship between my country and some neighboring countries has seen various changes over time. For example, with one particular neighbor, the relationship has become much stronger economically over the past decade. This is largely due to increased trade agreements and joint infrastructure projects, like building a high-speed rail line connecting major cities in both countries. These economic ties have led to more cultural exchange and tourism as well. However, with another neighbor, there have been periods of increased tension, often stemming from historical issues or disagreements over maritime boundaries. The reasons for these changes are complex, involving shifts in political leadership in both countries, global economic trends affecting trade dynamics, and sometimes, specific incidents that trigger diplomatic friction. Overall, while economic cooperation has generally increased with some, historical and political factors continue to influence relationships with others, leading to a mix of improving and sometimes strained ties.

Feedback 
You effectively describe changes in relationships with neighboring countries, providing examples of both positive (economic strengthening) and negative (tension over historical/boundary issues) shifts. You also offer plausible reasons for these changes, linking them to economic factors, political leadership, and specific incidents. Vocabulary related to international relations (trade agreements, joint infrastructure projects, maritime boundaries, diplomatic friction) is well-chosen. Using phrases like 'various changes over time' and 'reasons are complex' acknowledges the nuance of the topic. Good job explaining the 'why' behind the changes.
