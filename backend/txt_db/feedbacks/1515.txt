Question 
Talk about one industry that has developed a lot within a year.

Answer 
One industry that has developed a lot within the last year in my country is the renewable energy sector, particularly solar power. There's been a significant push from the government with new incentives and subsidies for installing solar panels on homes and businesses. This has led to a boom in installations and a rapid increase in the number of companies offering solar solutions. Furthermore, there's been investment in large-scale solar farms. The technology itself has also become more efficient and cheaper, making it more accessible to the average person. This rapid development is driven by a global focus on climate change, the need to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and the economic benefits of creating green jobs and energy independence. It feels like every month there's news about a new solar project or a new company entering the market.

Feedback 
You chose a relevant and currently developing industry and clearly explained the reasons for its rapid growth within the last year (government incentives, technology improvements, global focus). You provide specific examples like solar panels and solar farms. Vocabulary related to renewable energy and economics (incentives, subsidies, boom, investment, fossil fuels, green jobs) is appropriate. The phrase 'significant push from the government' is a good way to describe policy influence. Your answer is well-structured and easy to follow.
