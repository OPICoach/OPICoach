Question 
You indicated that you go shopping. When you go shopping, how do you decide what to buy? Does anyone help you? Tell me the steps you go through when you want to buy something new.

Answer 
When I go shopping, how I decide what to buy depends on what I'm shopping for. If it's groceries, I usually have a list and stick to it. If it's clothes or electronics, I usually do some research beforehand, like reading reviews online or comparing prices. I don't usually have someone help me, unless I'm buying something expensive like a car, then I might ask for advice. The steps are usually: realize I need something, research options, compare prices/features, go to the store or website, and make the purchase.

Feedback 
Good answer covering different shopping scenarios and processes. 'depends on what I'm shopping for' is a clear way to start. 'stick to it' is a natural phrase. 'do some research beforehand' is appropriate. The steps you list are logical and easy to understand. 'realize I need something' is a good starting point. 'make the purchase' is a clear concluding step. The structure is easy to follow.
