Question 
Have you ever been in a situation where you were dissatisfied with a product? When and where did this take place? Provide me with as many details as possible.

Answer 
Yes, I have. A few months ago, I bought a new smartphone online. When it arrived, the battery life was terrible, much worse than advertised. It also had a weird glitch where the screen would freeze randomly. I contacted the online store, and luckily, they allowed me to return it for a full refund. It was frustrating because I had to go through the hassle of packaging it up and sending it back, and then waiting for the refund.

Feedback 
This is a detailed and clear account of a negative experience. 'dissatisfied with a product' is correctly understood and applied. Describing the specific issues ('battery life was terrible', 'weird glitch', 'screen would freeze randomly') adds important detail. 'much worse than advertised' is a good comparison. 'go through the hassle of' is a natural phrase to describe the inconvenience. 'return it for a full refund' is the correct terminology. The narrative flows well.
