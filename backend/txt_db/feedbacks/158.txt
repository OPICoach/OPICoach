Feedback 
Sam praised Eddie's English level, stating he has AL potential and his English is very good, contrary to his IL score. Sam suspected the IL score might be due to sounding too scripted in the actual test. Sam advised Eddie to speak naturally like he did during the call for the next test. Sam highlighted good techniques used by Eddie, such as using phrases like 'you know, you want to know about my overseas trip?' to buy time, mentioning the time frame ('two years ago, or maybe or three years ago') to show thought process, and using correct structures like 'My friend and I went to Japan'.
