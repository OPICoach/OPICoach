Question 
Tell me about your favorite trip. Where did you go and where did you stay? Describe the place you stayed and someplace you visited. Give me all the details about the trip.

Answer 
My favorite trip was to Kyoto, Japan. I went there a couple of years ago. I stayed in a traditional ryokan, which is a Japanese inn. It was a really unique experience - we slept on futons on tatami mats, wore yukata robes, and had amazing multi-course Japanese breakfasts and dinners served in our room. We visited many temples and shrines, but my favorite place was the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove. Walking through those towering bamboo stalks was incredibly peaceful and beautiful. The whole trip felt like stepping into a different world.

Feedback 
Fantastic description of your favorite trip. You clearly state the destination and accommodation type ('Kyoto, Japan', 'traditional ryokan'). The details about the ryokan experience ('slept on futons on tatami mats', 'wore yukata robes', 'amazing multi-course Japanese breakfasts and dinners') are vivid and specific. Describing the Bamboo Grove ('towering bamboo stalks', 'incredibly peaceful and beautiful') is evocative. 'felt like stepping into a different world' is a great concluding sentence. The language is rich and descriptive.
