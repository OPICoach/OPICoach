Question 
You indicated in the background survey that you watch TV. Tell me about the TV shows you like to watch. What are they about? When do you watch them? What do you like most about them?

Answer 
I watch a variety of TV shows. I enjoy crime dramas, like detective series, and also some comedy shows. Crime dramas are usually about solving mysteries or catching criminals, and I like the suspense and the puzzles. Comedy shows are just for relaxing and laughing after a long day. I usually watch TV in the evenings, after dinner. What I like most is being entertained and escaping from daily stress for a while.

Feedback 
Good overview of your TV watching habits. Stating 'a variety of TV shows' is a good start. Naming the genres ('crime dramas', 'comedy shows') is clear. Briefly explaining what they are about ('solving mysteries or catching criminals', 'for relaxing and laughing') is sufficient detail. Mentioning when you watch ('in the evenings, after dinner') addresses that part of the question. Explaining what you like most ('being entertained and escaping from daily stress') covers the 'why'. The response is well-organized.
