Question 
Tell me about recycling in your country.

Answer 
That's an interesting question. There are so many things I can think of now. Let me think about it. When it comes to recycling here in Korea, we have a very developed recycling system. That is called 종량제. It is often said that people take it very seriously because recycling itself is very important and the government is very strict about that. So if you don't do it, you get a fine. You don't want to do that, right? Also, it is seen that people do recycling on a certain day, like every Thursday. Just like that. We sort out materials like plastic, cans, and aluminum, paper, things like that. Also, recycling is simple to do and it is a good way to protect our nature for the next generation. It is always right to protect our nature, right? We are living on the earth that is not ours. What I mean by that is that the earth is our next generations, not ours. So we need to pass it on to the next generation as it is now, as it should be. And recycling can be the one of the good ways to preserve the nature. So why not? It is not an option. It is a must. It's not a thing that we can do overnight, but together we can do it. We can definitely do it. And we got to do it. Just a little bit of effort can make a huge difference in the future. So let's do that. That's it. That's about it.

Use opening phrases like 'That's an interesting question.' and filler phrases like 'There are so many things I can think of now. Let me think about it.'. Convert 'in your country' to 'here in Korea'. Use phrases like 'It is often said that...' or 'It is seen that...' to introduce general observations or common practices. Include details and examples (e.g., '종량제', sorting materials, specific day). Use rhetorical questions (e.g., 'You don't want to do that, right?', 'It is always right to protect our nature, right?', 'So why not?') to engage the listener and add fluency. Structure the answer with a clear beginning, middle (details, reasons, examples), and end (conclusion, final remarks). Use concluding phrases like 'That's it.' or 'That's about it.'.
