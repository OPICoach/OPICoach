Question 
Tell me about the banks in your country. What are they like? Please describe them in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
First, you know, most banks are pretty similar to the ones in other countries like America, you know. I go to a KBK bank near my office. You know, the bank used to be always crowded with people. But now, you know, people can deal with most bank services online. We can even I mean we can even transfer money through a mobile instance message app called talk. Well actually I recently read an article that said Korea had been leading the fourth industrial revolution and um It also said that the first digital only bank had started off in Korea. As a result, you know, the number of banks in Korea has decreased. People don't need to go to the bank that often. Anyway, when I go into a bank, I see a security guard. There's a ticket machine in front of the counter or in the waiting area, so I take a number for my turn. I only go to the bank when I need to deposit cash or withdraw cash. But I often use ATMs. So overall, that's what I usually do at the bank and how banks are like.

Feedback 
The answer effectively describes banks in Korea, covering their appearance, services, and changes over time. Good use of filler words ('you know', 'anyway') for fluency. Vocabulary like 'pretty similar', 'used to be crowded', 'deal with services online', 'transfer money', 'deposit cash', 'withdraw cash', and 'ATMs' is appropriate. Mentioning specific examples like KakaoTalk adds detail. For higher levels (AL), incorporating information from articles or news about social trends (digital banks, decrease in branches) is a good strategy. The structure of describing the interior ('When I go into...') is useful for descriptions. Varying sentence patterns is key, even when discussing similar points. For IM-IH levels, a shorter answer focusing on basic description and common actions is sufficient.
