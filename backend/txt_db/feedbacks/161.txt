Question 
Tell me about the banks in your country, what do they typically look like, where are they usually located?

Answer 
Banks are really big here in Korea. It's amazing. They have really nice sofas, very high quality. Quite comfortable.

Feedback 
The answer starts with a clear description using 'really big', which is a good intensifier. Adding the emotional sentence 'It's amazing' makes the response more personal and engaging. The subsequent sentences 'They have really nice sofas, very high quality. Quite comfortable.' provide specific details and reasons for the initial description and emotion, using descriptive adjectives like 'nice', 'high quality', and 'comfortable'. This structure (Description + Emotion + Reason/Detail) is effective for elaborating on a topic.
