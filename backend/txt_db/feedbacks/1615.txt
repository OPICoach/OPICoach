Question 
In your background survey, you indicated that you like listening to music. Who's your favorite musician or singer? What kind of songs does he or she sing? Why do you like him or her? Tell me about him or her in detail.

Answer 
It's a great question because listening to music is something I love to do in my free time. I'm not so picky about music, so I can say there are many musicians I like. But if I had to choose one of my favorite singers, I would choose Beyonce. Beyonce is one of the most famous American pop singers. I think she's such a talented musician. She can sing, dance, and write songs. And she's really beautiful. In addition, she has an incredibly unique voice which I really like. What I like the most about Beyonce is that most of her songs are so powerful. Basically, her songs are full of upbeat melodies, and I really like the catchy rhythm and lyrics of her songs. So, some of the good songs by Beyonce are Love on Top, Single Ladies, and Listen. I also recommend her song If I Were a Boy. The song goes like this. If I were a boy Even just for a day I'd roll out of bed in the morning And throw on what I wanted and go. It's a good song. You should check it out sometime. Overall, I guess I can call her the Queen of Pop, and I understand why she became so famous.

Feedback 
This is a strong answer that directly addresses all parts of the question. The speaker introduces their favorite musician, describes her talents, explains why they like her using specific adjectives ('talented', 'unique voice', 'powerful', 'upbeat melodies', 'catchy rhythm'), provides song examples, and even includes a short lyric recitation, which adds a personal touch and demonstrates fluency. The structure is clear and easy to follow, making it suitable for IH/AL level.
