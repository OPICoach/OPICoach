Question 
How have coffee places changed over the years? How were they in the past and how are they now? Is there anything special about them today? Please tell me about any similarities or differences between coffee places in the past and today.

Answer 
Well, you know, um yeah, you know, coffee places have changed quite a bit, you know? Like back in the day, coffee shops were pretty simple. Um I mean, they were mostly just places to grab some coffee and that was about it. The atmosphere was pretty basic, and there weren't many options for coffee drinks or food. Nowadays, you know, coffee shops are totally different. Um most cafes have a huge variety of coffee drinks. Plus, many coffee shops now offer various food options. Also, these days there are many coffee shop chains like Starbucks, you know? Um yeah, another thing that popped into my mind is that coffee places have like top-notch espresso machines. Also, you know, they usually have apps for ordering coffee, which makes it really convenient. Besides these things, there must be other changes, but this is all I can think of at the moment.

(Regarding popularity) As you mentioned, um coffee shops have become super popular worldwide, and it's interesting to think about why that is. It seems that coffee shops are very popular because, you know, there are so many things to do. A big part of it, I think, is the atmosphere. You know, coffee shops offer like a cozy and inviting space, which is perfect for taking a nice coffee break. Besides, coffee shops are like great places to meet up with friends. Whether it's a casual catch-up, a business meeting, or like a date, coffee shops can be a perfect venue for these occasions. Plus, lots of people use coffee shops as a kind of like office away from home. You know, it's common to see people with their laptops on like sipping on a latte while they work. Besides these reasons, coffee itself has become more popular. As for me, I'm a huge fan of coffee. I'm not sure if I like the taste of coffee or I just need the caffeine. Um I'd say like coffee has become more popular because there are more coffee lovers than before. Also, these days coffee shops sell pastries or salad that you can have with your coffee. They're especially great for a quick breakfast or lunch. So when I need to grab something for lunch, I go to the nearby Starbucks. You know, they offer quick tasty options for people on the go. Whether you need a caffeine boost in the morning or a sweet treat in the afternoon or like a place to grab a quick bite, there's usually a coffee shop nearby.

Feedback 
The question asks about changes in coffee places over the years, requiring comparison between past and present. This type of question often appears as question 14 in the OPIc exam. It tests your ability to use different tenses (past for the past, present for the present, present perfect for changes over time) and comparative language. Useful expressions for this topic and comparison questions include: 'have changed quite a bit' (present perfect for change), 'back in the day' (for the past), 'that was about it' (to describe limitations in the past), 'totally different' (for present), 'huge variety' (for present options), 'various food options' (for present offerings), 'another thing that popped into my mind is...' (a good filler/transition), 'top-notch' (excellent quality), 'cutting edge' (state-of-the-art - applicable to machines, technology, facilities, etc.), 'apps for ordering coffee' (modern convenience), 'besides these things, there must be other changes...' (using a modal verb for nuance, showing spontaneity), 'this is all I can think of at the moment' (showing spontaneity).

The question about why coffee shops are popular worldwide often appears as question 15. It's a social issue type question. Useful expressions include: 'as you mentioned' (referencing the prompt), 'have become super popular' (present perfect for popularity change), 'it's interesting to think about why that is' (good conversational filler), 'it seems that...' (expressing opinion/likelihood), 'there are so many things to do' (listing reasons), 'a big part of it I think is the atmosphere' (highlighting a key factor), 'cozy and inviting space' (describing atmosphere), 'take a coffee break' (common phrase), 'besides' (linking word), 'meet up with friends' (using a phrasal verb), 'perfect venue for these occasions' (using appropriate vocabulary like 'venue' and 'occasions'), 'office away from home' (describing usage), 'it's common to see people with their laptops on like sipping on a latte while they work' (providing specific examples), 'coffee itself has become more popular' (focusing on the product), 'as for me' (introducing personal opinion/experience), 'I'm a huge fan of...' (expressing strong liking), 'I'm not sure if...' (expressing uncertainty), 'I'd say...' (expressing opinion, similar to I think), 'sell pastries or salad that you can have with your coffee' (describing food options), 'especially great for a quick breakfast or lunch' (describing convenience), 'grab something for lunch' / 'grab a quick bite' (useful phrasal verbs for eating), 'people on the go' (describing busy people).

General OPIc tips mentioned: OPIc evaluates your actual speaking ability, not just memorization. Practice and repetition are crucial. High scores require varied sentence patterns, conjunctions, relative clauses, correct tenses (including present perfect), varied vocabulary (beyond simple words), and good intonation/stress. Simply increasing answer length or taking tests repeatedly without practice won't guarantee a higher score if foundational skills are lacking. Don't feel pressured to answer every single part of the prompt; focus on the main topic and answer coherently. Referencing the examiner (Eva) like 'Eva, you're right' can be a good way to start or transition. Useful fillers and linking words are important ('you know', 'um', 'like', 'also', 'plus', 'besides', 'on top of that', 'on the other hand'). Using phrasal verbs (e.g., meet up, think of, grab something) makes your speech sound more natural. Modal verbs (e.g., must be) add nuance. For conclusions, especially in AL, you can try spontaneous-sounding phrases like 'Oh, time is up. So I should call it a day.' or 'I'm not sure if I've said everything I wanted to. If I had more time to think, I could say more but I will stop here for today.' Learning useful expressions and sentence patterns is recommended, but pure memorization without practice is not effective. Reviewing and practicing until expressions become natural is key.
