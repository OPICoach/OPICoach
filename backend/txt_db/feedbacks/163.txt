Question 
What is the difference between looking forward to and expectation?

Answer 
Looking forward to has anticipation plus want and usually requires an action (ing). For example, I'm looking forward to meeting you or I'm looking forward to seeing you. Expectation is simpler, just anticipation. It's feeling something will clearly happen, without wanting or doing. For example, I expect to meet with him soon or I expect the vacation will happen this summer.

Feedback 
Looking forward to implies awaiting something with desire (anticipation + want + action, often with -ing). Expectation is simply anticipating something will happen (anticipation only). A key difference is the 'want' and the need for an action/gerund with 'looking forward to'. Be careful with 'expecting'; it commonly means pregnancy/childbirth, especially in North America (e.g., 'I'm expecting'). This meaning is strong due to social context like teen pregnancy rates. It's safer to use 'expect' or 'expectation' for general anticipation and reserve 'expecting' for pregnancy unless the context is absolutely clear otherwise. The discussion on contraceptives (condoms, birth control pills) and Korean ID requirements for certain condoms provides background context for why 'expecting' has such a strong association with childbirth.
