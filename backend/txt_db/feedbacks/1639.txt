Question 
Have you ever had any memorable experiences that Bank? What was it like? What happened? Please tell me everything in detail.

Answer 
There was a time when I asked for a loan consultation, but the process took much longer than I expected. I felt frustrated about the delayed service and the lack of updates. I politely explained my concerns to the teller, and they tried to expedite the process. Although it wasn't perfect, I appreciated their effort to provide an alternative solution. This experience taught me the importance of asking detailed questions about fees beforehand.
