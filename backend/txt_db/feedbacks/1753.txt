Answer 
Um home in the past and present. Um you know, I tell you what. Um you know, I really love my home I I'm living in now because you know, I have um coffee machines. So I can drink coffee every single day. Um you know, um basically um in the past I didn't like um drink I I didn't like to drink coffee. So definitely there was no equipment related to coffee. So at the time, you know, um whenever my mom um wanted to drink coffee then she had to go to any cafes to drink that drink. Uh but um you know, nowadays um I don't know why but all of a sudden I'm really into drinking coffee. So I decided to buy a coffee machine and different flavor of coffee beans. So you know, even at home I can enjoy drinking coffee whenever I want. So um you know um so I don't have to spend a lot of money on um expensive Starbucks coffees. So um and you know I can start my day in

Feedback 
You did a very fantastic job. You followed the structure quite well. The beginning where you kind of struggled was a good strategy to show you're thinking. The part where you said "I don't know why but all of a sudden" was so solid and flawless, definitely higher than AL. It's a great strategy. However, focusing too much on coffee becomes a little bit risky because it might make the grader think you memorized a script about coffee that can be applied to any question. You need to make sure you bring it back to the 'home' point more clearly, like saying you enjoy drinking coffee *at home* or that your home is now like Starbucks. You went back to the home topic with "even at home I can enjoy it", which was very strong. You don't want to show that you have something prepared; this test is not scripted. Overall, very impressive.
