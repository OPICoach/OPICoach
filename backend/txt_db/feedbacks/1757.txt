Question 
What kinds of home appliances do you have at home? Which one do you mostly use in your daily life?

Answer 
These days I vacuum everyday. Because I shed a lot.

Feedback 
Using 'I vacuum everyday' is a good use of 'vacuum' as a verb. However, 'I shed a lot' is typically used for animals losing fur. For human hair loss, it's better to say 'I lose a lot of hair,' 'my hair is falling out all the time,' or 'I'm experiencing hair loss.'
