Question 
Fashion styles are always changing. Tell me about the different kinds of clothes that were popular when you were younger. What did the styles look like? How were they different from what is popular now?

Answer 
제 생각에 어 요즘은 black and white가 유행을 하는 거 같아요. 그리고 사람들도 그걸 되게 좋아하는 거 같아요. 왜냐하면은 그게 되게 입기 쉬운 컬러라서 그런 것 같습니다.

Feedback 
Excellent main point for the present part of this comparison question. You connect it to the previous topic (black and white) but use slightly different phrasing for the reason ('easy to wear'/'입기 쉬워서') instead of repeating 'safe colors.' This shows flexibility and avoids sounding repetitive. For the past, describing opposite styles (e.g., colorful, hard to match) is a good strategy.
