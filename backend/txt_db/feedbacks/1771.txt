I went to go shopping with my friend. Oh, do you like shopping? I went to go shopping보다 I went shopping으로 이 인간을 완전 초보하고 영어로 대화를 합니다. 그러면 한국 사람들이 많이 실수하는 거를 찾을 수 있겠죠. 그 대화로 문화 차이 그리고 뉘앙스 차이를 보여주고 어떻게 하면은 대화를 잘 할 수 있는지 대화 전략까지 보여줍니다. I'm showing you a different subway station every sentence. That's because you're likely on the subway watching this right now. Just like how my background is changing, your mom is also changing. 이 인간의 카드 긁을까 말까? 영어도 열심히 배울까 말까? Stop 고민ing! 초보들아, 초밥 탈출하자! Help me, help you. 오백 노잼 스피킹 받는 초보 영어.

Feedback 
This text appears to be a script or commentary rather than a direct answer to an OPIc question.  As an OPIc response, it presents several challenges:

1.  **Language Mixing:** There is significant mixing of Korean and English (e.g., '욕ing', '고민ing'). In an OPIc test, you should use only English.
2.  **Informality & Slang:** The language is highly informal and uses Korean slang ('이 인간', '초밥 탈출', '오백 노잼'). While OPIc is conversational, this level of informality is generally inappropriate.
3.  **Grammar & Usage:** There are grammatical errors in the English parts (e.g., 'stop 욕ing' should be 'stop criticizing' or 'stop talking badly about', 'stop 고민ing' should be 'stop worrying' or 'stop hesitating'). The text correctly identifies the issue with 'went to go shopping' vs 'went shopping', which is a good point.
4.  **Coherence:** The flow is disjointed. The sentences about the subway and 'your mom is also changing' are irrelevant to the topic of English learning and the latter is highly unusual and potentially offensive.
5.  **Content:** The text touches upon relevant points for Korean English learners (Konglish, pronunciation, common errors, cultural differences), which shows an understanding of learning challenges.

**Suggestions for Improvement in an OPIc Context:**
*   Use only English throughout your response.
*   Maintain an appropriate level of formality, avoiding slang and overly casual expressions.
*   Focus on clear and grammatically correct sentence structures.
*   Ensure your response is coherent and directly addresses the prompt (if there were one).
*   Avoid including irrelevant or potentially problematic statements.
