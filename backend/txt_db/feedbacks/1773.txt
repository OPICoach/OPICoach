Question 
Many people try to eat healthy these days. What kinds of foods are healthy and why are they healthy for us?

Answer 
Um, healthy food. Um, I would have to say, well, my country food, I mean Korean food, is one of kinds of healthy food. Uh, you think that what's so special? Uh, I would answer like in Korea, we usually eat rice with various kinds of side dishes made of meat, fish, vegetables, and sometimes fruits. And also we use a lot of seasonal fresh, fresh vegetables. So it is very balanced, low calories, and also so easy to digest. So I highly recommend Korean food for those who are suffering from, you know, obesity or for those who trying uh, trying to lose weight. So I try to eat Korean food at least twice a day.

Feedback 
Overall, this was an excellent and very solid answer. It was brief but contained a lot of information and was easy to follow. The use of 'I would have to say' is very natural and highly recommended, much better than phrases like 'I would like to talk about' or using sequential markers like 'first, second, last, moreover, furthermore, in addition' which sound robotic in conversation. The initial phrase 'my country food' was slightly awkward, but the self-correction with 'I mean Korean food' was good. A suggested alternative could be 'food here in my country' or 'most Korean food is quite healthy' for better flow and accuracy. The long sentence describing Korean meals (rice with various side dishes made of meat, fish, vegetables, fruits) was excellent and shows a high level of English proficiency and confidence. The explanation about why it's healthy (balanced, low calories, easy to digest) was also very good. Using 'for those trying to lose weight' is a kinder and more natural way to phrase it compared to directly mentioning 'obesity'. The conclusion, stating that you eat Korean food at least twice a day, was very natural and effective. The speed and flow were excellent, making it difficult for the listener (Sam) to keep up, which is a good sign of fluency.
