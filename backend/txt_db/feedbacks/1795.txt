Question 
Describe a time you faced an unexpected problem or emergency.

Answer 
Well, I have a very interesting story to tell you because basically the other day I was riding my bike and I felt like I needed to take a dump. But the problem was, you know, there was no washroom nearby. And so I was riding this bike very slowly and kind of standing up, if you know what I mean. And it was just such an uncomfortable situation because oh my gosh, you know, I was experiencing turtlehead. Oh my goodness, it was an emergency situation. Um, but luckily I was able to find Starbucks. Oh, thank goodness for Starbucks. And of course, you know, I had to just rush in and, you know, unload my beast. After that, I felt so relieved.

Feedback 
This answer is noted as potentially more difficult due to the spontaneous use of advanced vocabulary. Key terms highlighted are 'take a dump', 'turtlehead' (explained as needing to defecate urgently but holding it back), and 'unload my beast' (or 'unleash my beast', meaning to defecate). These words are presented as impressive but might be challenging for some students.
