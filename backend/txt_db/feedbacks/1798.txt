Question 
Can you tell me about the changes you've heard about concerning the relationship between your country and other countries? The change might have happened in areas such as economics, sports, arts, culture, or politics. Please provide a detailed description of any observed changes.

Answer 
Option 1 (Avoidance): Well this is a pretty difficult question for me because I don't have much knowledge about the relationships between Korea and other countries. I think like to explain them, I should know specific terms, but unfortunately I don't. One thing that came to my mind is that Korea has positive relationships with lots of countries in many ways. Well, you know, I'm sorry but this is all I can tell you about this question.

Option 2 (Detailed): For example, South Korea has signed various free trade agreements with many countries. Additionally, Korean movies and K-pop music have gained global popularity, resulting in extensive cultural exchanges with so many countries. In the past, Korean culture didn't receive much attention, but nowadays many Korean artists perform worldwide and appear in various movies. Also, in terms of sports, South Korea actively engages in exchanges with multiple countries and successfully hosted the Winter Olympics a few years ago. So, it seems that Korea is maintaining positive relationships with various countries.

Feedback 
This is a very difficult question. An avoidance strategy is acceptable, especially for lower levels (IM-IH). Phrases like 'One thing that came to my mind is that' and 'in many ways' are useful. For higher levels (AL), providing details is necessary. Examples like FTAs, K-pop/movies leading to cultural exchange, and hosting the Olympics are good points. Useful phrases include 'in terms of', 'when it comes to', 'it seems that', and 'various countries'. Using 'For example' is fine in OPIc.
