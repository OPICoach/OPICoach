You know, well, um I live with my family in an apartment in Seoul, you know, which is a very big and bustling city. However, my neighborhood is a quiet suburban area.

You know, especially there is a subway station just like five minute walk from our school, which makes it very convenient for me to go to school. As for the living room, you know, it's quite spacious as we don't have a lot of furniture. You know, the living room always has a warm and bright atmosphere. So, um my family enjoys spending time there. Um on the balcony, well, my mom has various plants that she takes care of.

Start with fillers like 'You know', 'Well', 'Um'. Describe the city and neighborhood using adjectives (bustling, quiet, suburban). Use patterns like 'What I like the most about...'. Describe rooms and furniture using diverse adjectives (spacious, warm, bright, old-fashioned, decent, ordinary). Use 'As for...' to introduce topics. Vary sentence structure. Use specific vocabulary (convenient facilities, subway station, atmosphere, appliances, refrigerator/fridge, floor lamp). If you don't have much to say about a topic, state it directly ('I'm not a big fan of cooking, so I don't have much to say...'). Practice pronunciation and stress (convenient, atmosphere, refrigerator, homework, own, focus, comfortable, cafe, cuisine, genre). Vary your tempo and intonation. Shadowing helps improve delivery and learn patterns like 'it's got'.
