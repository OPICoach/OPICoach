Question 
Can you tell me what you usually do at a park? Describe your typical day at a park from beginning to end.

Answer 
Oh, here's my park routine. You know, um the bench area is really important to me because it helps me to adjust my workout pace. Of course, I do other things at the park too like taking a photo in front of the flower beds like, you know, the flowers made me smile. So that's why that picture is better than other picture. Plus I really like to making a wish in front of the fountain like buying tossing tossing the coin and making a wish. But what I really like is a bench area. Like, you know, I can take a rest with a bench. Plus I can by taking a rest that makes me adjust to my rhythm, my workout rhythm. So my park routine starts and ends with a bench. First I found find the bench and then I rest on it.

Feedback 
The student's answer focuses too much on the 'bench area' (description) instead of the 'routine/habit' (action) which was the main focus of the question. While the student successfully concentrated on one thing, it was the wrong category. The use of examples like 'flower beds' and 'fountain' was good for adding detail (Step 3), but the overall focus should have been on the action (e.g., jogging, walking). The answer also lacks insights or reflections (Step 5) which are crucial for higher scores (AL). The structure mixes description and habit. It's important to clearly distinguish between description and habit questions and focus on the correct category. For habit questions, focus on actions and use transition words like 'whenever', 'of course', and 'also' effectively. To improve, focus on the 'jogging' or 'workout pace' aspect as the main theme, incorporate the examples (flower beds, fountain) as secondary activities done *while* or *around* the main activity, and add a reflection using phrases like 'I've realized' or 'I've learned'.
