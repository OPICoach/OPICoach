Feedback 
Acknowledged nervousness but said the student did well. Provided feedback during practice about avoiding starting with 'I rarely do this,' using a 'white lie' for 'recently' (e.g., changing 3 years to 3 weeks) to fit the question, and the importance of connecting the main point (OST) back into the body of the answer to maintain coherence.
