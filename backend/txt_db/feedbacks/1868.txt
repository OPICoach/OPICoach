Question 
How were cafes and coffee houses like in your childhood? Were they really popular? Describe what you remember in detail.

Answer 
Let me start off by saying this. I think these days cafes are well, just so amazing. Simply because you can stay there for long hours and no one's gonna say anything to you. I think that's really cool, right? because like back in the days, it wasn't quite like this. I mean, if you were to stay there for like three hours or so, if the boss were to be there, they give you the cut eye. And that wouldn't be a great feeling at all. And so you'd feel burdened. You'd feel forced to buy a lot more things so that you could stay there longer. Yeah, that completely sucked. But these days, wow, what a completely different story. You can pretty much go to any cafe, just order a single cup of coffee and that gives you the right to stay there for many hours. And I think that's awesome. I mean, you could study, you could have long conversations with a friend, whatever you want. just by one cup of coffee can let you stay there and that wouldn't be considered loitering. It would just be normal.

Feedback 
The answer effectively uses a comparison structure between past and present cafes, which directly addresses the question asking about childhood experiences. The main point is clearly stated upfront. The transition to the past uses 'because like back in the days', where 'like' is highlighted as a useful filler for AL and 'back in the days' is a good phrase for referring to the past. 'It wasn't quite like this' is praised, with 'quite' noted as an AL-level word. The example for the past uses 'I mean' and repetition of 'if you were to stay there... if the boss were to be there', demonstrating Rule Number 5 (repetition). 'They give you the cut eye' is a vivid and natural expression for glaring or staring angrily. The follow-up sentence 'And that wouldn't be a great feeling at all' effectively expresses the emotion tied to the previous point, with 'at all' adding emphasis. The consequences in the past are described using 'you'd feel burdened' and 'you'd feel forced', showing the feeling of pressure. The repetition of 'you'd feel' is another example of Rule Number 5, making the answer easy to follow. The contracted form 'you'd' is recommended for OPIc flow. The past section concludes with 'Yeah, that completely sucked', using 'Yeah' as a natural transition when finishing a point and 'sucked' as a strong, albeit slang, expression for something being bad or the worst. The transition to the present uses 'But these days, wow, what a completely different story'. The interjection 'wow' is noted as a skillful pause that adds impact and makes the sentence more dynamic. For the present, 'You can pretty much go to any cafe' uses 'pretty much' to mean 'almost' or 'basically', and 'You can' is used to introduce an example. 'That gives you the right' is a good phrase meaning 'gives you the privilege' or 'permission'. The comparison is reinforced by mentioning 'many hours' in the present versus the implied limitation in the past. Expressing opinion with 'And I think that's awesome' adds personality. More examples for the present are introduced with 'I mean, you could', showing variation from 'I mean, you can'. The repetition of 'you could' for listing activities (study, conversations) is another application of Rule Number 5. The concluding sentences summarize the benefit ('just by one cup of coffee can let you stay there') and explicitly contrast it with the past by saying 'that wouldn't be considered loitering', using 'considered' as a good word for 'seen as' or 'regarded as'. Overall, the answer demonstrates excellent use of comparison, examples, repetition, natural fillers ('like', 'yeah'), emotional expression, and varied sentence structures suitable for an AL level.
