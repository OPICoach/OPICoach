Question 
Tell me about a transportation problem that you once faced. (New scenario, continuation)

Answer 
Yeah, um, yeah, I know, uh, it's definitely not trains or subway's fault. It's definitely my fault. But, um, I sometimes, um, I couldn't forgive myself like this. So, um, well, so that's the, what can I say?

Feedback 
Remember to use the past tense for past experiences. Change "It's definitely my fault" to "It was definitely my fault." You could add humor, like saying you ended up blaming the train because you were frustrated with yourself. To apply the 99-1 strategy here (focusing on the negative 99), you could mention the frustration/blaming the train (99), quickly mention something positive that came out of it like getting breakfast or chocolate (1), and then return to the negative outcome like being very late and having to apologize (99). Always mention the solution or lack of solution in the conclusion.
