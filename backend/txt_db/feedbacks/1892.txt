Question 
Describe a bar you like to go to.

Answer 
I like bars with delicious dishes. The bar I go to often has always wine and I go to often with my friends. I really like that bar, but the most amazing part is their cocktail like a lot.

Feedback 
Starting with 'I like bars with delicious dishes' is an acceptable main point as it includes feeling and a key feature. However, repeating 'often' in different contexts within the same sentence ('I go to often... and I go to often with my friends') sounds weak and awkward. The repetition strategy works best when repeating the same meaning, ideally close together, to emphasize a point (e.g., 'I often go... very often... maybe too often'). Similarly, 'I really like that bar... like a lot' is awkward because 'like a lot' is separated from 'I really like'. For effective repetition, keep similar ideas or words close ('I really like that bar like a lot'). A simple main point note could be 'bar, like, cocktails'.
