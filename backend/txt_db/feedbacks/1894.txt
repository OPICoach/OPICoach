Question 
Describe a bike you own or ride.

Answer 
My bike is small and cute. I usually ride a bicycle around my home. It's really fun. Honestly, I don't have a bike, so I haven't ridden a bike recently.

Feedback 
Using 'and' to list attributes ('small and cute') is often weak and sounds scripted. It's better to choose one attribute (e.g., 'small') and elaborate on it in various ways to show descriptive ability. Using 'a bicycle' is less specific than 'my bicycle' or 'my bike'; be specific when talking about your own things. Using pronouns like 'it's' frequently is good for AL. Stating 'Honestly, I don't have a bike' after talking about riding it makes the narrative confusing and difficult to elaborate on. It's better to simplify the story and talk about currently riding a bike (a 'white lie' is acceptable) to make the answer flow smoothly and provide more material for elaboration. Don't make it unnecessarily hard for yourself.
