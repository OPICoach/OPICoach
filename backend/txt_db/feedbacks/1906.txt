Feedback 
Avoid excessive 'um' sounds; use '어' or '아' instead. The initial speed was too fast; start slow and gradually increase speed. 'I'm Regina' is a good, friendly start. For 'I'm pink queen. I really love pink.', state the simple fact ('I really love pink') first before using a playful term. Using 'You know what I'm saying?' is good. Consider short, rhythmic sentences. The content jumps abruptly from pink to alcohol; connect ideas or focus on one theme. Grammatical correction: 'I'm quite a productive person'. 'Proactive' is a good alternative word. Practice pronunciation like 'are time'. End clearly. Focus on one or two connected themes and keep the introduction concise (under 1 minute).
