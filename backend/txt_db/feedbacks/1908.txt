Question 
I want to know what you feel about English.

Answer 
Oh, bad. Because English is hard and I have to learn more things. That's just more fun. If I solve a question, I feel great. But English question is not great. No. My parents will kill me.

Feedback 
The student clearly states their negative feeling about English and provides reasons (it's hard, requires learning many things). The answer uses simple, direct sentences and basic vocabulary, which is easy to understand. The contrast between feeling great when solving other questions versus English questions is a good detail. The final comment about parents is a natural, albeit humorous, expression. For improvement, the student could try to elaborate more on specific difficulties or use slightly more varied sentence structures.
