Question 
I'd like to give you a situation to act it out. You need to open a new bank account. Go to the bank and ask the representative three or four questions to learn everything you need to open an account.

Answer 
Hello. I want a new account here.

Feedback 
The answer was too short and did not demonstrate the required dialogue for Role Play 11. Role Play 11 requires a dialogue (conversation between two people) showing repetition of the implied response and moving in a positive direction (e.g., 'Yes, you can open the account'). Suggested opening phrases include 'Hi there,' 'I came to open up a bank account,' or 'I'm here to inquire about opening up a new bank account.' It's important to use vocabulary appropriate to your level (e.g., 'credentials' for ID card). Nowadays, adding TMI (Too Much Information) like the reason for needing the account (e.g., new job, lots of money) is also recommended for a higher score.
