This is a past experience question. When you first hear the question, identify its category (e.g., past experience, description, comparison). When you hear it a second time, focus on the main points, especially the 'why' behind feelings. In the 6/6 strategy, the first question is description/habit, and the second is usually past experience or comparison. Use the grace period after answering to anticipate the category of the next question.
