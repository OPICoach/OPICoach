Feedback 
This is a past experience question. Practice answering description/habit questions within 1 minute. Past experience and comparison questions can ideally be 1 to 1.5 minutes, but practicing for 1 minute helps with conciseness. The specific 'when' (e.g., 5 years ago) doesn't matter unless the question asks for a specific time frame (e.g., 'when you were a child'). Past experience questions are good opportunities to boost your score.
