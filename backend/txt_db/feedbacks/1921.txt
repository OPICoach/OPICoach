This is a comparison question (100% for 'I Hate You Set 14'). It can be a comparison over time (past vs. present) or between two different entities (A vs. B). Don't be surprised by unusual topics; you can invent details if needed (e.g., a karaoke group). Use the opposite contrast strategy (e.g., present group is good because X, past group was bad because opposite of X). 'Tone deaf' means 음치.
