Question 
May I mention regarding any president of the United States in the test? Might it be a plus point?

Answer 
It is not recommended to talk about famous people, including presidents.

Feedback 
Talking about famous people like presidents is risky. The OPIC grader might not be American, or if they are, they might know more about the person than you do. This could lead to high expectations or make any small factual error sound significant. It's safer to talk about someone less famous.
