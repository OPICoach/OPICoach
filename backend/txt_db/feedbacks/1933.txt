This answer uses the S-R-R strategy (Simple, Repeat, Reason). 'The test was hard' is the simple statement. 'Like it was so hard' repeats the feeling using a filler ('Like it was') and an intensifier ('so'). 'I didn't study enough' provides the reason using appropriate past tense ('didn't study'). This structure adds depth beyond a simple statement.
