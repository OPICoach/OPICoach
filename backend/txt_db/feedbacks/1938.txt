Question 
Describe a dessert you ate.

Answer 
The chocolate cake was sweet. Seriously, it was really sweet. It had a mix of different kinds of chocolate.

Feedback 
This answer uses the S-R-R strategy. 'The chocolate cake was sweet' is the simple statement. 'Seriously, it was really sweet' repeats the feeling with 'Seriously' and 'really'. 'It had a mix of different kinds of chocolate' gives the reason, correctly using the past tense ('had').
