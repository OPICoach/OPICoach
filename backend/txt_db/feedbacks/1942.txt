Question 
Tell me about the furniture you have in your home. Is there a piece that is your favorite?

Answer 
Um, actually, my favorite furniture is um the sofa in the living room. Um, and the reason I really like that sofa because um it makes me feel comfortable just sitting there. You know, this the sofa is a um in a yellow and when I see sofa in the living room, I see the like sun beaming into um the into into the living room and I just sit there and you know, and think about, you know, all the stress things and just just relax and and I really um feel like my stress relieved and so I really like that, you know, that sofa because of the stress kind of um relief I guess so yeah.

Feedback 
Good use of 'um, actually' as a natural filler before starting, but be careful not to overuse it in every answer. The main point (favorite furniture is the sofa because it's comfortable and relieves stress) is clear. Including details like the sofa being yellow is good, but try to connect these details back to the main point (e.g., 'even though it's yellow, I don't care because it makes me feel relaxed'). The connection between the yellow color and the sun beaming was a strong, creative detail that effectively supported the main point. Using 'stress relieved' is okay, but consider more dynamic expressions like 'my stress just goes poof' to sound more natural and engaging. The slight laugh at the end adds a human touch.
