Question 
I would like to know where you live. Can you describe your home to me? What does it look like? How many rooms does it have? Give me a description with lots of details.

Answer 
Okay, my house. Alright. Actually, I'm, I'm living in three rooms apartment with my family. And you know, just my home is like just normal house. So I have living room or just bedroom like that. But you know, I love my home because oh, I have two toilets. Yeah. Because oh, it's really really what I like because when I when I live in other home, I just had one toilet so we had a lot of trouble like that. Whenever I want to pee like that, my brother was using there so it is kind of annoying. But you know, I have two toilets now so we don't need to worry about that. So it's it's I think it's a really good benefit. Yeah. So for those reasons, I love my home.

Feedback 
The main point (living in a 3-room apartment with family, loves the home) is established. While initially stating it's a 'normal house', the answer quickly pivots to a specific, personal detail: having two toilets. This detail is excellent because it's unique and leads to a relatable story about past inconvenience (fighting with brother over one toilet) and current satisfaction. Connecting this specific detail to the reason for loving the home ('really good benefit') effectively supports the main point. This approach of focusing on a unique, personal aspect and elaborating on it is very effective for OPIc.
