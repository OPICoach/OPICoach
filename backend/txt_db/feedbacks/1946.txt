Question 
Talk about the first coffee shop you ever went to.

Answer 
음, I say it was Cafe Moa when I was in high school. But I can't say for certain. Anyway, I think that place was more known for their ice cream than their coffee. And you know, they put so many toppings and I thought it was wonderful. My friends and I went there for the first time after an exam. Um, you know, it was our way to celebrate. When we went there, they had parfait which was ice cream with fruits and snacks in a tall cup. I would say it was quite pricey for students. But they gave us free bread too. So I thought it was quite worth it. You know, it's funny because their ice cream was so good that we didn't even think about ordering any coffee. And so it was pretty ice creamtastic if you know what I mean.

Feedback 
When answering, the goal is to answer immediately. If you can't, show you're thinking briefly (under 5 seconds). Show emotion while thinking (e.g., 'interesting', 'oh wow'). You can briefly mention the main word from the question (e.g., 'oh the first coffee shop'). Practice starting immediately. Using 'I think' is good for detail; compare 'It was Cafe Moa' vs 'I think it was Cafe Moa'. Use natural phrases like 'when I was in high school' or 'in my high school days' instead of 'when I was a high school student'. 'But I can't say for certain' is excellent for AR level detail. 'I think that place was more known for...' clearly conveys the message. Using 'I thought it was wonderful' adds feeling; combine 'I think' and 'I thought' naturally. Start with 'My friends and I' (put others first). 'For the first time' is smooth. Adding small details like 'after an exam' is good if it doesn't confuse the main message. The story flow (exam -> celebrate) is excellent ('It was our way to celebrate'). 'When we went there' adds good detail. For more detail, try 'which was pretty much ice cream' or 'which was something like ice cream'. 'I would say' or 'I would have to say' are great expressions; avoid 'I would like to talk about'. Avoid unnatural transition words like 'moreover' in conversation. 'Quite pricey' is very natural; 'pricey' is a good alternative to 'expensive'. 'But they gave us free bread too' is good. 'I thought it was quite worth it' explains the value well. 'It's funny because...' is a good expression for something unexpected; 'It's interesting' is an alternative. 'We didn't even think about ordering any coffee' is much better than 'we didn't order any coffee' for AR level. 'Pretty' is a good small word like 'quite'. Blending words like 'ice creamtastic' is a higher skill (beyond AR) but can be risky; 'ginormous' is another example. 'If you know what I mean' is a very common native expression. Overall, the answer is clear, focused (on ice cream), has good flow, sounds natural, and shows skillful use of tense and vocabulary, making it very believable.
