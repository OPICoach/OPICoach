Question 
When did you first become interested in music? What kinds of music did you like first? Tell me how your interest in music developed from your childhood until today.

Answer 
Uh, gosh, uh, tough question. Well, hmm. Well, since I was 10 years old, uh, my preference of music hasn't been changed at all. The first time I was into jazz was about 20 years ago. It was on Christmas season, and during that time, I was in the States, staying at home with my father's friends. As I remember, he owned lots of vinyl, and when he played songs.

Feedback 
This is a comparison question. You used the 'emergency mode' by going straight to the past. While not bad if you're stuck, when practicing, try the 'pure present' main point structure first. Your goal should be to master the first 30 seconds with a clear pure present main point for comparison questions.
