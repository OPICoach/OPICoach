Question 
Please describe your memorable vacation at home. When was it? Who did you spend your vacation with? What did you do that made the experience so special?

Answer 
I'm sorry, but the transcript provided is a lecture explaining how to answer OPIc questions about past experiences. It includes example questions and sentence structures, but it does not contain a student's answer to the question you've provided. Therefore, I cannot offer feedback on a student's response.

Feedback 
The provided text is a lecture script, not a student's answer. To provide feedback, please provide the actual OPIc answer you would like me to review.
