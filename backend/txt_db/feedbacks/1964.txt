Question 
I'm interested in the conference. Can you tell me about the date, location, registration, and the schedule after lunch?

Answer 
The conference will be taking place in the main auditorium of the Palace Hotel on April 23rd. Yes, you can register at the venue on the day of the conference. However, the seating is limited, so I suggest registering in advance. Sure, there'll be three sessions after lunch. First, at 1:00, Luis Henderson will give a keynote speech. After that, at 2:00 PM, David Park will give a lecture about setting goals. Lastly, there'll be a question and answer session led by Maria Gibson from 3:00 to 4:30 PM.

Feedback 
This answer provides clear and concise information about the conference details requested. It covers the date, location, registration options and recommendation, and the specific schedule after lunch including speakers and topics. To provide specific feedback on sentence structure, vocabulary usage, and fluency, the spoken response would be needed.
