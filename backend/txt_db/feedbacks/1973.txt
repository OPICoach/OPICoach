Question 
Why are bus drivers so rough in Korea?

Answer 
Okay. That's true. Favor 아닌데. You're gonna pay me. I love money. Oh, 1 minute. Conglish 아니고 믹스지. Unsafe. Oh, really? ready to get off. No idea.

Feedback 
Your answer includes several useful English phrases and words, such as 'That's true,' 'I love money,' 'Unsafe,' 'Oh, really?,' and 'No idea.' These are good for expressing agreement, reactions, and simple statements. You also used the phrase 'ready to get off' correctly within a sentence. However, you frequently mixed English phrases with Korean words or sentences (e.g., 'Favor 아닌데. You're gonna pay me.', 'Conglish 아니고 믹스지.'). For OPIc, try to construct full sentences entirely in English to express your ideas more completely. For example, instead of just 'Unsafe,' you could say 'It feels unsafe when...' or 'I think it is unsafe because....' Practice forming complete English sentences to describe your experiences and opinions.
