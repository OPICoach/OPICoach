Question 
Can you tell me about the last time you had some free time? When was it? What did you do? Did you spend the time with someone?

Answer 
Uh, okay. I went to Swiss with my sister for about a few months ago, and it was freaking awesome because I got to go skydiving. And um, talking about it makes me wanna call up my sister and go there again. Anyway, we stayed there just for a few days, and I didn't have that much time to travel. So I had no choice but to choose only one activity. And um, if only I had more time. Anyway, I decided to go skydiving as my main activity. And believe it or not, I didn't feel nervous at all before I went skydiving. But when I was about to jump, I was like, "Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! I can't do this! I can't!" And then I think I passed out for a few seconds, and then when I woke up, and I was, uh, it was the thrilling thing, the most thrilling thing that I ever experienced. And um, next thing you know, I was on the ground. And um, you know what? Oh, after this test, I think I should call my sister round for round two.

Feedback 
The first half of the answer is quite good because the main point (skydiving) is clear and everything builds upon it. However, the second half has issues with self-correction and focusing too much on grammar, which makes the message less clear. The goal is to make the message easy to understand, not grammatically perfect. Specific feedback points:
- "Swiss" should be "Switzerland" (the country).
- "for about a few months ago" is grammatically awkward. "About a few months ago" is better. Using a filler like "uh, you know" can help when correcting.
- It's good to state how you felt immediately after stating the main point ("freaking awesome").
- "freaking" is slang, acceptable if comfortable.
- Explaining *why* you felt that way ("because I got to go skydiving") is good.
- Adding another person (sister) adds complexity, which is good for AL. Even if alone, mentioning wanting to bring someone adds detail.
- The expression "talking about it makes me wanna call up my sister and go there again" is natural and increases quality. Adding "just" ("just talking about it...") is also good.
- Using "just" in "we stayed there just for a few days" adds detail.
- Focusing on not having much time and having to choose one activity keeps the focus on the main point (skydiving).
- Using "if" ("if only I had more time") adds a higher level of complexity and sophistication, good for AL.
- Taking time to get to the main point (skydiving) is okay if done naturally.
- Focusing on one thing (skydiving) throughout the answer helps maintain focus, unlike students who jump between topics (food, people, scenery).
- Expressing feelings and elaborating on them is crucial for increasing language ability and makes the answer more personal and easier to understand.
- "And believe it or not" is an excellent expression for something unusual.
- "at all" is well-used ("didn't feel nervous at all"). Be careful with pronunciation ("all" not "or").
- Simple details like "when I was about to jump" are effective.
- Using direct quotations ("Oh my gosh!...") makes the answer dynamic and shows grammar skill (past tense narrative + present tense quote).
- "passed out for a few seconds" is a great detail.
- The part after "when I woke up" is the weakest due to excessive self-correction. Use fillers instead of breaking the message. Example: "when I woke up, okay, you know, I lost all my fear, and I thought it was the most thrilling thing...".
- "the next thing you know" is an awesome idiom. Using "the" is slightly more accurate ("the next thing you know...").
- "you know what?" is a good transition.
- The conclusion idea ("call my sister for round two") is great, but the delivery was weakened by self-correction. Rephrase with fillers if needed: "after this test, I think I should call up my, uh, my, my sister. Okay, I should call up my sister, and you know, go for round two."
