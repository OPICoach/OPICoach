Question 
What are your plans this weekend?

Answer 
Um, you know, I'm planning to watch Netflix this weekend. I don't know you've heard about this TV show called Love is Blind. Um, this TV show is so popular in the world these days. You know, I never tried watch this before because I was so busy at work and I was working ass off. Anyways, uh the format of this TV show is quite interesting. You know, the man and women basically they're dating each other without seeing their face each other. And then the man can propose to the women and after proposal, uh they get married and they can see their face each other for the first time. It's unbelievable. You know, I'm just saying this, I cannot wait for this weekend and this TV show.
