Question 
I would like to now talk about where you live. What is your favorite room in your home? What does it look like? What is your normal routine at home?

Answer 
My favorite room in my home is definitely the living room. It's where I spend most of my relaxing time. It's quite cozy, with a big, comfortable sofa and a large TV. There are also some bookshelves filled with books and plants in the corners. The walls are painted a light gray color, which makes it feel calm. My normal routine at home usually starts with having breakfast in the kitchen, then I move to the living room to check emails or read the news. In the evenings, after work or study, I relax on the sofa, watch TV, or read a book. Before bed, I usually spend some time tidying up a little.

Your description of your routine is also clear, covering morning and evening activities. Using transition words like 'then' and 'In the evenings' helps the flow. 'Tidying up a little' is a natural phrase. Overall, a strong answer with good detail and vocabulary.
