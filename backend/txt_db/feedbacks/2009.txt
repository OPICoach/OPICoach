Question 
Describe for me your first trip to another country. When was the trip? Where did you go? Who did you go with and what did you do? Describe that experience for me in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
My first trip to another country was when I was in middle school, maybe around 14 years old. I went to Guam with my family – my parents and my younger sister. It was a package tour, so everything was planned for us. I remember being so excited to fly on an airplane for the first time and see the ocean in a different country. Guam is a tropical island, so the weather was warm and humid. We stayed at a hotel near the beach. During the trip, we spent a lot of time at the beach, swimming and playing in the sand. We also went snorkeling, which was amazing because I saw so many colorful fish. We did some sightseeing, visiting some historical sites and lookout points. We also went shopping for souvenirs. The food was different from what I was used to, a mix of American and local Chamorro cuisine. The whole experience felt very new and exciting. It was my first time experiencing a completely different environment and culture, even though Guam has a lot of American influence. It was a fantastic first international trip.
