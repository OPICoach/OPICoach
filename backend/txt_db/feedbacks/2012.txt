Question 
I'm sorry, but there is a problem that I need you to resolve. You were supposed to meet with a nutritionist later today, but something has suddenly come up. Call the office and explain the situation. And provide some alternative options.

Answer 
Okay, I understand. (Ring ring...) Hello, is this the nutritionist's office? Hi, my name is [Your Name]. I have an appointment scheduled for later today at [Time of Appointment] with [Nutritionist's Name], but I'm so sorry, something unexpected has just come up, and I won't be able to make it. It's an urgent matter that I need to attend to. I apologize for the late notice. Could I possibly reschedule? I'm available tomorrow afternoon, maybe around 2 or 3 PM, or perhaps sometime next week? Any day next week, except for Friday, would work for me. Please let me know what times are available. Thank you for your understanding.

Feedback 
Very good role-play for rescheduling. You started politely, identified yourself and the appointment details ('my name is [Your Name]', 'appointment scheduled for later today at [Time]', 'with [Nutritionist's Name]'). You clearly stated the problem ('something unexpected has just come up', 'won't be able to make it', 'urgent matter'). You apologized sincerely ('so sorry', 'apologize for the late notice'). You directly asked to reschedule ('Could I possibly reschedule?'). You provided clear alternative options ('tomorrow afternoon, maybe around 2 or 3 PM', 'perhaps sometime next week?', 'Any day next week, except for Friday'). You ended politely ('Please let me know what times are available', 'Thank you for your understanding'). This is a realistic and effective way to handle the situation.
