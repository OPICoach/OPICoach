Question 
I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. You want to make a doctor's appointment. Call the doctor's office and ask three or four questions about making an appointment.

Answer 
(Acting out) Hello, I'd like to make an appointment to see Dr. Lee. Is he available sometime next week? What are his office hours on weekdays? Also, I was wondering if you accept [mention a specific insurance name, e.g., National Health Insurance]? And how long is a typical appointment?

Feedback 
Good job acting out the scenario. You clearly stated your purpose and asked relevant questions covering availability, hours, insurance, and appointment length. This demonstrates good communication skills for the situation. Speaking slightly more naturally, as if on a real call, would enhance it.
