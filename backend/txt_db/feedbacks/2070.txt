Question 
Tell me about an experience when you had to cancel an appointment you made. What happened? Why did you have to cancel the appointment? And how did you deal with the situation?

Answer 
Okay, last semester, I had a very important meeting scheduled with my professor about a project. However, on the morning of the meeting, I woke up feeling very sick with a bad cold and fever. I knew I couldn't go and also didn't want to spread germs. So, I immediately called the professor's office to explain my situation and apologize for the late notice. He was very understanding and we rescheduled the meeting for a few days later when I was feeling better.

Feedback 
You provided a clear example of a cancelled appointment, explained the reason (sickness), and described how you handled it (calling, explaining, apologizing, rescheduling). This is a complete and well-structured answer. Adding a detail about how you felt (e.g., disappointed to miss the meeting) could add more depth.
