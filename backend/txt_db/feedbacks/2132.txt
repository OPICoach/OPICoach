Question 
Problems often come up because of our dependence on technology. Think about a time when you experienced a problem due to some piece of technology not working properly. Maybe your computer crashed or your cell phone had no service. Tell me about a time when you had some kind of problem getting your technology to work.

Answer 
Well, technology problem. Oh, alright. You know, I have to tell you this story related to my AirPods. You definitely have heard of Apple's AirPods, right? Um, you know, just for you, just for the record, um I usually prefer listening to music while I'm studying. So, um, during the day, as always, I was preparing to listen to music before studying. So, um, I really made it sure, um the Bluetooth had no problem. But, um, as soon as I played the first music, it turned out, um, it had a problem. So, um, I played the music in public by accident in the library, in the, in the really quiet library. Um, so, um, I was really, um, embarrassed, so I was like, "What the fuck is happening now?" And, um, I really tried to stop the music, but, you know, I, I couldn't. I was not able to because, you know, you know what? Um, if you're too embarrassed, then it gets nearly impossible for you to do really easy things, right? Um, anyway, um, finally, I stopped the music, but, um, maybe it was too late. So, I was able to feel like all the other people in the library, um, were giving me some cut eye. Yeah, it was quite scary, and, yeah, I was really scared. Um, anyway, uh, this is the story I remember. Um, I mean, this is the most unpleasant story I remember, which happened recently. Um, you know, anyway, here's the lesson. Um, you know, um, nowadays, um, the wireless earbuds, um, have been trending all over the world. But, um, you know, sometimes just the conventional earbuds is way better.

This answer demonstrates key strategies for achieving an AL score. 1. Talking to Ava: The student effectively uses 'you' expressions ('You know', 'I have to tell you', 'You definitely have heard of... right?') to create a conversational feel, which is crucial for this test. Recommended variations include 'I gotta tell you' and 'I'm sure you've heard of... right?'. 2. Developing the Story: The student starts with a clear main point (AirPods problem) and then provides details, making the story easy to follow within the time limit. This structure is more effective than starting immediately with details. 3. Swearing: The use of 'What the fuck is happening now?' adds emotional intensity and sounds natural for the speaker, demonstrating strong communication skills. Swearing is acceptable in moderation if it fits your natural speaking style and helps convey emotion. Smoother alternatives like 'What the fuck is going on?' or 'What the fuck is happening?' can also be used. Avoid excessive or unnatural swearing. Mastering these three points significantly helps in moving from IH to AL by showcasing strong conversational ability and clear story delivery.
