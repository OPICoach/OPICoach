The question is a habit category question. The answer is a bit short, aim for over 10 sentences. Avoid saying you study Opic, but studying English is fine. For the first sentence, instead of 'For furniture, I normally use definitely desk', try 'When it comes to furniture, I normally use a desk/my desk' or 'In terms of furniture, I normally use a desk/my desk'. Using 'normally' is good. To connect the idea of studying English, use 'especially', like 'Especially when I study English' or 'Especially when I need to study English'. Instead of 'So actually I need to use a desk, right?', try describing the desk and its suitability for studying, e.g., 'It's a big desk so it's perfect for studying.' 'Big', 'wide', 'long', 'large' are all acceptable descriptors for Opic. For 'When I wake up, I sit down in front of the desk', add detail like 'in the morning' or a specific time (e.g., 'at 8 o'clock in the morning'). Use 'my desk' instead of 'the desk'. Consider using 'As soon as I wake up' for a more advanced expression.
