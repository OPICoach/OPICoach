Question 
I'm sorry, but there is a problem I need you to resolve. When you and your friend arrive at the theater, you discover that they've sold the wrong tickets to you. Explain the situation to the ticket seller at the booth. Offer two or three alternatives to solve the problem.

Answer 
Oh, hey, what are doing? We bought some, you know, we bought the Lion King, the ticket, but you gave me the, you know, the Wizard of Oz. What are doing? You I I just want to change the ticket. Oh, so, can I change the ticket? Uh, oh, you can't? I can't? Why not? Oh, it's already sold out. All right, so, um, uh, then, can we just, uh, watch the show, uh, tomorrow? Um, oh, you we can't? Why not? Uh, yeah, it's it's not not the day of the performance. All right, so how about, you know, how about, um, next week? Oh, there is a performance on Tuesday, right? Okay. So, yeah, actually, you know, I feel really, you know, offer because of this, because of your mistake. So, yeah, I hope, yeah, you don't make the mistake again next time. All right, so, okay, then, I will just, uh, stop by this this theater next week. Okay. So, all right, bye. Yeah, thank you.

Feedback 
Your English is quite good, but nervousness seems to cause some grammatical mistakes. Try to relax and have fun with the role play. Regarding your answer:
1.  Opening: Your attempt at an 'angry' tone with 'Oh hey what are doing?' sounded timid, not angry. If you want to show anger, use phrases like 'What are you doing man?' or 'What is this man?'. However, it might be easier to adopt a polite approach like 'Excuse me, I think you may have made a mistake' or 'I think there's a bit of a mistake here.' Practice saying 'Excuse me' with a smooth, slightly shorter pronunciation.
2.  Explaining the situation: 'We bought the Lion King the ticket but you gave me the Wizard of Oz' is okay. You could also say 'We wanted to watch Lion King but you gave us tickets for Wizard of Oz.'
3.  'What are doing?': Again, the tone felt off. If you want to sound tough, use 'what you doing man?' or 'what you doing bro?', but this doesn't seem like your natural character. Sticking to a 'good guy' persona with phrases like 'I think there's a clear mistake here' is likely more effective for you.
4.  First question: 'can I change the ticket?' is grammatically correct but sounds awkward. Better options include 'can we get the proper tickets?', 'can you exchange the tickets?', 'could you fix this for us?', or 'can you give us tickets to Lion King?'. 'Exchange' is generally more suitable than 'change' here.
5.  Reacting to 'No' (sold out): Your reaction 'Oh you can't? I can't? Why not?' was good for showing communication. Add emotion with phrases like 'Oh that sucks,' 'That's unfortunate,' or 'Oh man.'
6.  Strategy (No, No, Yes): You used a three-question strategy (No, No, Yes). While possible, the standard and often easier strategy for Role Play 12 is two questions (No, Yes). You made it harder for yourself unnecessarily. Stick to the simpler No, Yes structure.
7.  Showing frustration: 'I feel really awful because of this because of your mistake' felt more like an angel complaining than someone genuinely upset. If you're not comfortable portraying anger convincingly, don't force it. A simple, slightly disappointed tone is fine.
8.  Second question (after the first 'No'): Instead of asking about tomorrow's show, a common and effective second question for ticket issues is about a refund. For better communication flow, ask the main question followed by a sub-question, e.g., 'All right then, could we get a refund? Would that be possible?'
9.  Conclusion (after getting 'Yes'): If the refund is possible, a good conclusion could be 'Excellent. Then you know what? Please just give us the refund and we'll just watch Lion King next time. Thanks and good.'
Overall, choose a character persona (like the 'good guy') that feels natural and easy for you to portray, and focus on the standard two-question (No, Yes) strategy for Role Play 12.
