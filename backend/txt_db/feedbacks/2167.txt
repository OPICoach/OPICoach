Question 
Homes have changed a lot over the years. How were they 5 to 10 years ago and how are they now? What are some characteristics of these homes?

Answer 
Okay. These days lots of people live in apartment because I mean lots of people prefer to live apartment because there's lots of convenience. But back in the days like like like 10 years ago they live in just house not apartment but like living living in a house is not that convenient so they they doesn't they don't like live there. So now they're move to apartment and there.

Feedback 
Good start following the comparison strategy (Present first). Focus on using adjectives to show contrast in feelings (e.g., convenient now vs. inconvenient before). Using fillers like 'like' makes the speech sound natural. Repeating words from the question (like '10 years ago') is good. Try to speak a little slower to avoid rushing and potential errors like 'they doesn't they don't like live there' (should be 'they didn't like living there'). Remember to use 'people', 'we', 'us' when talking about society, not just 'my family'.
