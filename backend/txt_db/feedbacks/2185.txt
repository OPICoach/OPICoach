Question 
What kinds of companies do young people want to work for these days? Why do they want to work for those companies?

Answer 
The text constructs a sample answer based on the MP+2 strategy. It suggests focusing on one company (e.g., Samsung), stating it's a great company because it pays a high salary (MP). Then, it suggests adding +1 by mentioning other companies (Google, Apple) or other benefits (welfare, work-life balance), and adding another +1 by coming back to the main point (e.g., salary is the primary reason people want to work there). It concludes simply.

Feedback 
For this question, focus on one main company (e.g., Samsung). Use 'for Samsung'. Add feeling/emotion ('It's a great company') and the main reason ('because they pay a high salary'). This is the Main Point (MP). Apply the MP+2 strategy: +1 means mentioning something else briefly (other companies or other benefits), and the second +1 means returning to the main point (why the chosen company/reason is the primary one). Conclude simply. This MP+2 strategy is recommended for beginners (IL, IM1) aiming for IH.
