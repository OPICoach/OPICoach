Question 
Have you ever had any problems with your co-workers or boss? What was the problem and how did you resolve it?

Answer 
I remember I had an argument with my team leader because he sometimes made impossible demands. As a result, I had a hard time at the work. Uh sometimes I also had trouble working with my co-worker. But we usually apologize to each other and become closer after world. However, my team leader was very strong. I don't know why. He always made me unreasonable request. Like ask me to park someone else's car or to drink with him after work. Yes. These things made me very angry. And eventually I quit the job. Uh I never want to experience that time again.

Feedback 
The first sentence, "I remember I had an argument with my team leader because he sometimes made impossible demands," is very good. The phrase "As a result" is a good word, but in conversation, it sounds more natural when connected to the previous sentence with "and," like "and as a result" or "and because of that." The phrase "I had trouble working with my co-worker" is difficult to use smoothly; "trouble" is often used when you are in trouble for doing something wrong. It's better to use phrases like "had issues" or "had problems." The answer starts with a negative example (bad boss) and then moves to another negative example (co-worker issues). While not necessarily bad, contrasting with a positive example (e.g., no issues with co-workers) can improve the flow and show range. Using "and" at the beginning of a sentence, like "And eventually I quit the job," is acceptable in conversational English and makes the flow smoother. However, using "and" in the middle of a sentence to list negative adjectives (e.g., "bad and crazy") is not recommended; choose one adjective instead.
