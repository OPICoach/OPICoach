Question 
What kinds of technology do people typically use in your country? Do people use computers, cell phones, or handheld devices? What are some common forms of technology that people use?

Answer 
Um, so in my country, um, our cell phones, um, is very important. Every single, everyone owns a cell phone. This is, um, part of our life. It connects to everywhere. Um, it allows us to set an alarm to before we go to sleep. In the morning, wake up, you know, you first thing you hear is your alarm sound. And the first thing you go is your phone, you know, checking notifications. And it just it, it's something that, you know, it's so attached to us and it's so, um, connected to every single part of our life. We can't, it's, it's we need it. It's like, it's a point where we need it and we use it and yeah. So, cell phone is the, you know, technology device that we use the most in our country.

Feedback 
The student uses fillers like 'um' and 'you know' effectively and quickly, making them sound natural. However, there are grammatical errors: 'cell phones is' should be 'cell phones are', 'everyone owns a cell phone' should ideally include 'a' or be pluralized consistently, 'our life' is pronounced as 'are life' (which the instructor notes as a potentially faster way to speak but points out the pronunciation difference), 'It connects to everywhere' could be clearer (e.g., 'It's able to connect everywhere'). The detail about 'connecting' is unclear (internet, computer, etc.). The phrase 'set an alarm to before we go to sleep' includes an unnecessary 'to'. The phrase 'And at first thing you go with your phone, you know, checking notifications' is confusing and could be clearer (e.g., 'And as soon as you wake up, you probably check your notifications'). The student switches between 'we' and 'you' when talking about people, which is noted as an advanced but potentially confusing skill. The phrase 'it's so attached to us' is awkward; 'we are attached to it' or 'we're dependent on it' is better. The student uses 'it' repeatedly, which, combined with self-correction ('it just it, it's something that'), makes the message less clear initially. The phrase 'every single part of our life' is praised as natural. The self-correction 'We can't, it's, it's we need it' is highlighted as a weakness. The phrase 'It's like, it's a point where we need it' is corrected to 'It's like we're at the point in our lives where we need it'. The student uses 'and' excessively when running out of things to say. The conclusion is reached quickly when the student runs out of ideas, which is presented as an effective emergency strategy. Overall, the answer lacks sufficient feeling-based content; it describes the use of smartphones but doesn't fully convey the emotional connection or importance from a personal perspective.
