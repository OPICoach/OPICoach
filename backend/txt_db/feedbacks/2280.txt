Question 
What is your typical day like when you go to a movie theater? What do you do before and after you watch a movie?

Answer 
Whenever I go to the movie theater, you know, I tend to eat popcorn usually in that place, you know. Because, you know, I really like to eat especially onion flavor.

Feedback 
The use of 'you know' is too frequent and sounds unnatural, giving the impression of a memorized script. Placing 'you know' consistently at the end of phrases creates a noticeable and negative pattern. There are also grammatical issues such as 'in that place' (should be 'in those places') and awkward phrasing like 'eat especially onion flavor'. To sound natural, fillers like 'you know' should be quickly combined with the following word (e.g., 'you know I'). If you need to pause to think, the pause should come after the combined filler + next word phrase (e.g., 'you know, because...'). Pausing after just 'you know' is generally unnatural unless it's used as a question. For habit questions, focus on one main point (MP) rather than listing everything you do before and after. Keep the answer concise (around 1 minute) and avoid relying on scripts, especially filler scripts, as they are easily detected by examiners.
