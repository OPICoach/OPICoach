Question 
Tell me about your favorite place from your childhood. What does it look like? What kinds of things did you do there?

Answer 
My favorite place when I was child is a small park near my home. It has a big tree in the middle and some benches. There was also a small playground with a slide and swings. I used to go there almost every day after school. I played with my friends, we run around, climb the tree, and sometimes we just sit and talk. It was a very happy place for me.

Your answer is good and directly addresses the question. Here are some specific points:

Sentence structure:
- "My favorite place when I was child is a small park..." -> "My favorite place when I was a child was a small park..." (Use 'was' for past, add 'a' before 'child').
- "It has a big tree..." -> "It had a big tree..." (Maintain past tense consistency).
- "There was also a small playground..." -> Correct.
- "I used to go there almost every day after school." -> Correct.
- "I played with my friends, we run around, climb the tree, and sometimes we just sit and talk." -> This sentence mixes past and present. It should be: "I played with my friends. We ran around, climbed the tree, and sometimes we just sat and talked." (Use past tense for all actions in the past).
- "It was a very happy place for me." -> Correct.

Word choice:
- "child" -> "a child" (Need the article 'a').
- "run around" -> "ran around" (Past tense).
- "climb the tree" -> "climbed the tree" (Past tense).
- "sit and talk" -> "sat and talked" (Past tense).

Overall, your description is clear. Focusing on consistent past tense will improve fluency.
