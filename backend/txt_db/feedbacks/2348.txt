Question 
Tell me about the banks in your country. What do they typically look like? Where are they usually located? What do you do from the moment you walk into the bank until you walk out? Tell me everything about what goes on when you visit the bank.

Answer 
Banks in my country vary a lot, but generally, they look quite modern and secure. They often have a large glass facade, a spacious lobby with ATMs, and counters where tellers assist customers. You'll find them commonly located in city centers, shopping malls, or busy commercial areas, making them easily accessible. When I visit a bank, which is less frequent now due to online banking, I usually walk in, maybe take a number from a machine if it's busy, and wait for my turn. I'll go to the counter to deposit money, withdraw cash, or ask about a service. After finishing my transaction and getting my receipt, I simply leave. The whole process is usually quick unless there's a long queue.

Feedback 
You provide a good general description of banks and their locations. Your explanation of the process from entering to leaving is clear and sequential. Good use of phrases like 'vary a lot' and 'easily accessible'. Consider adding a bit more detail about the atmosphere inside or the interactions with staff to make it more vivid. Also, ensure consistent use of tenses when describing the typical process.
