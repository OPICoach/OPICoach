Question 
You indicated in the survey that you like to take vacations domestically. Tell me about some of the places you like to travel to and why you like going there. Can you tell me about things you do in order to prepare for trips?

Answer 
I really enjoy exploring my own country. One place I love visiting is the mountains in the north. I go there because I enjoy hiking and the scenery is absolutely breathtaking, especially in the autumn. Another favorite is a coastal city in the south. I like it for its delicious seafood and relaxed atmosphere. To prepare for these trips, I usually start by researching the destination online to find interesting places to visit and good restaurants. I book accommodation and transportation in advance, especially during peak season. I also make a packing list to ensure I bring everything I need, like hiking gear for the mountains or swimwear for the coast. Finally, I make sure my camera is charged!

Feedback 
You provide clear examples of places you visit and explain your reasons well, using descriptive words like 'breathtaking' and 'relaxed atmosphere'. Your explanation of trip preparation is logical and detailed, covering research, booking, and packing. Good use of sequence words like 'start by', 'book in advance', and 'finally'. You could try varying sentence structure slightly more for added fluency.
