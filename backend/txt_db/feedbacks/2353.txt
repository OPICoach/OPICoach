Question 
Where do people in your country go to in their free time? Do they go to beaches? Do they go to parks or any other places? What are some popular free time locations in your country? What do people typically do in their free time? What is special about those activities?

Answer 
In their free time, people in my country enjoy various activities and visit different places. Yes, beaches are popular, especially during the summer for swimming and relaxing. Parks are also very common destinations, particularly in urban areas, where people go for walks, exercise, or picnics. Other popular locations include shopping malls, cinemas, restaurants, and cultural sites like museums or galleries. People typically spend their free time socializing with friends and family, pursuing hobbies like sports or arts, watching movies, or simply relaxing at home. What's special about these activities is that they offer a chance to unwind, connect with others, and experience different aspects of life outside of work or study. For instance, going to a park allows people to enjoy nature and fresh air, which is a nice contrast to being indoors all day.

Feedback 
You provide a good overview of popular free time locations and activities in your country. You directly answer the questions about beaches and parks. Explaining *why* these activities are special adds depth to your answer. Using examples like 'socializing with friends and family' and 'pursuing hobbies' is effective. You could perhaps mention a specific popular park or beach if you wanted to add more concrete detail.
