Question 
Describe a memorable experience or a problem you encountered.

Answer 
Once, I purchased a smartphone online, expecting top-notch performance based on the advertised specifications. However, upon receiving it, I realized the battery life was significantly shorter than expected, and the camera quality was subpar. Despite the promising features listed, they didn't meet my standards. It was frustrating because I heavily relied on these aspects for work and personal use. I had to go through the hassle of returning the device and finding an alternative that better suited my needs, emphasizing the importance of thorough research before making tech purchases.

Feedback 
Excellent use of vocabulary like 'top-notch', 'subpar', and 'significantly shorter'. The phrase 'go through the hassle' is natural and idiomatic. The concluding sentence effectively summarizes the lesson learned. Good command of past tense verbs.
