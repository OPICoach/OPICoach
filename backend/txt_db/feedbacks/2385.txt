Question 
Describe a memorable experience or a problem you encountered.

Answer 
Yes, I once went on a beach trip with friends that was unexpectedly affected by bad weather. We had been looking forward to a weekend of sun, sand, and relaxation, but unfortunately, heavy rain and thunderstorms rolled in shortly after our arrival. Our plans for beach volleyball and swimming were dashed, and we found ourselves cooped up indoors for much of the trip. Despite the setback, we made the most of the situation by playing board games, watching movies, and enjoying each other's company indoors. While it wasn't the beach getaway we had envisioned, the unexpected turn of events brought us closer together and created lasting memories of resilience and adaptability in the face of adversity.
