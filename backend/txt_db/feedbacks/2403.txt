Question 
Tell me about a memorable trip you took. Where did you go, who were you with, and what made it so memorable?

Answer 
Okay, I remember one trip very well. It was maybe five years ago. I went to Jeju Island in Korea. I went with my family, my parents and my younger sister. We stayed at a nice hotel near the beach. The weather was very good. We went to the beach every day. We swam and played games. One day, we went hiking on Hallasan mountain. It was beautiful but very tiring. The most memorable part was the food. Jeju has special black pork and seafood. We ate a lot of delicious food. Also, the scenery was amazing. The sea was very blue. It was a really good trip because I spent time with my family and enjoyed the nature and food.

Feedback 
Your answer is clear and directly addresses the prompt. You provide good details about where you went, who you were with, and what you did. Here are a few specific points for improvement: - "It was maybe five years ago": "About" or "around" could also be used here, like "It was about five years ago." - "The weather was very good": While correct, you could use more descriptive adjectives like "sunny," "pleasant," or "perfect" to make your description more vivid. - "Jeju has special black pork and seafood": "Special" works, but you could also say "famous" or "local specialty" to emphasize that these are well-known foods from the region. - "enjoyed the nature and food": This phrase is slightly unnatural. A more common way to say this would be "enjoyed the natural scenery and the delicious food." Or you could separate them: "enjoyed the beautiful nature and the delicious food." Overall, your response is easy to understand and covers all the required points. Focusing on using more varied vocabulary for descriptions (like weather and scenery) and slightly more natural phrasing for connecting ideas will help you sound even more fluent.
