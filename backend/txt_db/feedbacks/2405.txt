Question 
I'd like to give you a situation to act it out. You would like to buy a new cell phone. Call a store and ask three or four questions about a new phone you would like to purchase.

Answer 
Hello, I want to buy a new phone. I have some questions. First, how much is this phone? Second, what colors do you have? And can I pay by credit card?

Feedback 
Your questions are relevant and clear. 'I want to buy a new phone' is good, but 'I'd like to buy...' is slightly more polite. 'How much is this phone?' is perfect. 'What colors do you have?' is also good. 'Can I pay by credit card?' is a correct and common way to ask about payment. You asked three good questions.
