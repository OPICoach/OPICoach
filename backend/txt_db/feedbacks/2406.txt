Question 
I'd like to give you a situation to act it out. You want to get two tickets to see a performance during your vacation. Call the box office and ask three or four questions to get tickets.

Answer 
Hi, I want to get two tickets for the performance on [Date]. How much are the tickets? Are there any seats available together? Can I get a refund if I can't go?

Feedback 
Your questions are appropriate for the situation. 'I want to get two tickets...' is fine, adding the date makes it more specific. 'How much are the tickets?' is correct. 'Are there any seats available together?' is a very practical question. 'Can I get a refund if I can't go?' is also a good question about policy. You asked three clear questions.
