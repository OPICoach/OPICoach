Question 
I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. Someone in your family is going on a vacation and you have agreed to take care of his or her responsibilities at home. Call your relative and ask three or four questions to get all the information you need.

Answer 
Hi [Relative's Name], I'm calling about taking care of things while you're away. What time should I feed the cat? How often do I need to water the plants? Is there anything else I should know?

Feedback 
Starting with 'Hi [Relative's Name]' and stating the purpose is natural. 'What time should I feed the cat?' and 'How often do I need to water the plants?' are specific and practical questions for this situation. 'Is there anything else I should know?' is a good general question to cover anything missed. Very appropriate questions.
