Question 
I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. You are at a clothing store and need to get some clothes. Ask two or three questions about the clothes you would like to buy.

Answer 
Excuse me, I like this shirt. Do you have this in a different size, like medium? What other colors does this come in? Is this on sale?

Feedback 
'Excuse me' is polite. 'I like this shirt' identifies the item. 'Do you have this in a different size...?' and 'What other colors does this come in?' are common questions when shopping for clothes. 'Is this on sale?' is also very practical. Good questions.
