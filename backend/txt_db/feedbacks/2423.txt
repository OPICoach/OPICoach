Question 
I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. Your friend has just returned from a vacation to the United States. Ask your friend three or four questions to find out everything you can about his or her trip.

Answer 
Welcome back! How was your trip to the US? Where did you go? What was your favorite part? Was it expensive?

Feedback 
'Welcome back!' is a nice greeting. 'How was your trip...?' is a standard opening question. 'Where did you go?' asks for the destination(s). 'What was your favorite part?' asks for a highlight. 'Was it expensive?' is a common practical question. Good questions to hear about a trip.
