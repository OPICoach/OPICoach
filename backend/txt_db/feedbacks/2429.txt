Question 
I'd like to give you a situation and ask you to act it out. Your group received a proposal to do a performance. Discuss and plan the performance with your members.

Answer 
Okay everyone, we got a proposal for a performance. What kind of performance should we do? When is the deadline for the proposal? Who wants to take the lead on this?

Feedback 
Addressing the group ('Okay everyone') is appropriate. 'What kind of performance should we do?' is a key decision point. 'When is the deadline for the proposal?' is crucial for planning. 'Who wants to take the lead on this?' asks for volunteers or assigns responsibility. Good questions for starting a group planning discussion.
