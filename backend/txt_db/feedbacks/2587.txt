Question 
You indicated in the survey that you go on a trip internationally. I would like you to describe one of the countries or cities you have visited.

Answer 
I love traveling to New York City, which is definitely one of the most fascinating destinations in the world. The city is well known for being well developed and having many tourist attractions. Just letting you know, the main reason I enjoy going there is that it is such an interesting place. Another good thing is that there are so many things to do and so many things to see, whatever you go. I can't wait to have back there. I still have a vivid memory of it. I wish I could return to that moment.

Feedback 
This response for international travel to New York City demonstrates how to adapt the structure for a city destination, contrasting with nature. The opening 'definitely one of the most fascinating destinations in the world' is strong. Instead of 'undeveloped', it uses 'well developed and having many tourist attractions'. The core structure 'the main reason I enjoy going there is that...' and 'Another good thing is that...' is effectively used. The concluding phrases are similar, with a slight variation 'vivid memory' instead of 'vivid picture'. This highlights the strategy of preparing a flexible answer structure that can be applied to different types of travel destinations (nature vs. city) for both domestic and international trips, increasing efficiency.
