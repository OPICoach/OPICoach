Question 
Describe the last place you visited related to the geography of your country. What was special about that place? What did you do there? Tell me everything about the landscape and why you went there.

Answer 
Last month, I went to Seoraksan National Park. It's in the east part of Korea. It is very famous for its beautiful mountains. The landscape is amazing, with big rock peaks and colorful trees, especially in autumn. I went there because I love hiking and nature. I hiked up to a peak, which was difficult but the view was amazing. We also visited a temple inside the park. It was special because the mountain scenery was so dramatic and peaceful at the same time.

Feedback 
Excellent detail about Seoraksan, including its location, features (rock peaks, trees), activities (hiking, visiting a temple), and the reason for your visit. You used good descriptive words like 'amazing,' 'colorful,' 'dramatic,' and 'peaceful.' This is a strong answer. To make it even better, you could add a specific detail about the hike or the view, like the name of the peak or a particular color you saw.
