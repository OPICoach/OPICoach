Question 
I'd like to know about the place where you live. Do you live in an apartment or a house? What does it look like? How many rooms does it have? Describe it in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
I live in an apartment in Seoul. It's a modern building, about 15 floors high. My apartment is on the 8th floor. It's not very big, maybe around 80 square meters. It has three rooms: a living room, a kitchen, and two bedrooms. There are also two bathrooms. The living room has a big window with a view of the city. The kitchen is small but functional. The bedrooms are simple. It's comfortable for me and my family.

Feedback 
You provided clear details about your apartment type, location, size (using square meters is good), number of rooms, and a brief description of each area. Mentioning the view is a nice touch. To add more detail, you could describe the style, the furniture, or the atmosphere of the place. For example, 'The living room is bright and cozy,' or 'The kitchen has white cabinets.'
