Question 
Compare the home you lived in before to the one you live in now. What are the differences between those two homes? Describe them in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
Okay, before I lived in a small house in the suburbs. It was older than my current apartment. The house had a small garden, which was nice, but it needed a lot of maintenance. It had two floors, with the living area downstairs and bedrooms upstairs. It felt more spacious than my apartment, but it was also colder in winter and hotter in summer because it wasn't as well insulated. My current apartment is smaller but much more modern and convenient. It's all on one floor, which is easier. There's no garden, but the building has good facilities like a gym. The biggest difference is the location; the house was quiet but far from the city center, while the apartment is in the city, close to everything, but can be noisy.

Feedback 
This is a very good comparison, highlighting multiple differences: type of building (house vs. apartment), age, size, features (garden vs. facilities), layout (two floors vs. one floor), insulation/temperature, and location (suburbs vs. city, quiet vs. noisy, far vs. close). You used comparative structures effectively. Adding a concluding sentence about which one you prefer and why would make it even stronger.
