Question 
How many hours do you sleep per night?

Answer 
I usually sleep six hours a day. But I don't think it's quite enough for me. Because when I sleep under 8 hours, I easily get tense and distracted by everything around me during the work. So it's quite often to do overwork and it's not due to the task, but it's because of me concentrate less than others. So these days I'm trying to finish my work on time and wanting to trying to do is not sleeping more. You know what? I really like hanging out during the night time, so I'm not gonna sleep more. I don't want to give up my night time. So I'm gonna just concentrate more and more.

Feedback 
The student used the sentence "I easily get tense and distracted by everything around me at work." The word "everything" here is a good example of Hyperbole (Figurative Language). Using Hyperbole adds emotion and can help improve your score (e.g., getting 3 points). This is more impactful than a simpler phrase like "I usually get tense and distracted easily at work." When using Hyperbole, remember to slow down to sound natural and convey emotion effectively. (Teacher also provided an edited version for smoother flow).
