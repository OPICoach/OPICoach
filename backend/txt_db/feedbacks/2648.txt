Question 
Where do people in your country go to in their free time? Do they go to parks or beaches? Tell me everything about the places people go to in their free time.

Answer 
I guess people usually go to parks whenever they have free time because uh, you have the freedom to do various activities there. And um, I think people love to have options at a park and the options are endless. And um, you know, the many parks have trails, so many people tend to ride their bikes there. And um, the scenery is great and the air is quite fresh. And, you know what? What am I saying? I guess some people prefer relaxing instead. And so, a lot of them chicken, order their chicken and beer and um, chat up a store with their friends. But, you know what? That's the common theme to do here in Korea. And of course, there's another option. Another option is to just simply lie down on the grass and occasionally you can even see some people busking. those random performances are the performances are definitely a special treat. I think, you know, it's the no-brainer to go to parks because there are so many things to do and it's like a playground for adults.

Feedback 
The answer starts naturally with 'I guess', showing thinking on the spot, which is good for OPIc. The main point about having 'freedom to do various activities' is solid and clearly states why parks are popular. Including that 'people love to have options' adds crucial detail. While the main point was a bit long, it was effective. Using filler combos like 'And um, you know' helps with smoothness. Be careful when breaking a thought mid-sentence, like with 'the many parks'. It's better to repeat the word ('the the parks') or use a filler before continuing if you change the word. The word 'tend' is excellent for showing frequency. 'quite' is also a good descriptive word ('quite fresh'). Phrases like 'you know what' and 'What am I saying?' make the answer sound human and show you're thinking, which is a good strategy when you pause. 'instead' is a great word for transitioning between different activities (bikes vs. relaxing). The mistake 'a lot of them chicken' was confusing; when a thought breaks, try to repeat the phrase or use a filler before correcting ('a lot of them, uh, order chicken and beer'). 'chat up a storm' is a good idiom. 'But, you know what' again adds interaction. Suggest changing 'the common theme/thing' to 'a common thing'. The phrase 'Another option is' was a bit awkward; emphasizing with intonation or simplifying the sentence structure ('You can just simply lie down...') would be better. 'occasionally' is a good frequency word, and 'even' is an excellent small word for adding detail. The sentence 'those random performances are the performances are' had a similar break issue; repeating 'those' or using a filler would improve clarity. Change 'the no-brainer' to 'a no-brainer'. Adding 'there' at the end of 'there are so many things to do' ('so many things to do there') makes it more precise. The simile 'like a playground for adults' is a great way to conclude with clear imagery. Overall, the answer is very good, natural, detailed, and uses a variety of vocabulary and structures effectively despite a few minor stumbles.
