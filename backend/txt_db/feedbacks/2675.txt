Question 
Tell me about some popular places tourists like to go to when traveling outside your country. Why do they like visiting those locations?

Answer 
I think tourists like to go to the gift shops when they're traveling abroad. Because they can buy a lot of gifts. People also like to visit a lot of restaurants. People also like to go to the beach to take pictures. But people like to visit gift shops the most. Because they want to buy gifts to their family or friends. I realized that buying gifts is fun. That's why I think people love to visit gift shops.

This is a Description/Overseas Travel question. S: State the main popular place (gift shops/souvenir shops) and why tourists like it. M: Mention other popular places (restaurants, beaches) and a simple reason why they like them. Use 'also'. Keep M points simple, maybe just one sentence each. A: Return to the main place from S and add a little more detail or emphasize why it's the most popular. R: State something you realized about this topic (e.g., buying gifts is fun). Use 'I realized that...'. T: Conclude by restating your main point. Consistency within a combo set is important; treat it as one big question.
