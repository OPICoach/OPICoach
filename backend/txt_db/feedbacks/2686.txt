Question 
Where do you usually go hiking? When do you usually go? And who do you usually go with?

Answer 
My wife and I, we have a fun little tradition and that is every Thursday we go hiking together. And whenever we go hiking it's usually at a park that is near our home and we like to just relax you know? And we like to just breathe in the nice air and just talk about random things. That's what we like to do whenever we go hiking. And of course sometimes we like to goof off a bit. We like to horse around. We like to pick out some flowers here and there. put it on our ears and take pictures together. We like to be silly sometimes. But for the most part we are serious adults. I mean we are we are getting older now. And so whenever we go hiking we just end up talking about deep things. We just like to let it all out. Yeah that's what we like to do. And you know what I'm really starting to appreciate that you know just having some nice quality time with my wife spending time together like this it just you know it really makes life worth living.

Feedback 
This answer follows the S.M.A.R.T. strategy. S (Main Point): Starts by stating the habit (hiking with wife on Thursdays) and the main activity (talking about random things), using natural patterns like 'My wife and I, we...' and adding words like 'little' and 'just' for an AL feel. Uses 'whenever' effectively for a habit question. M (Examples): Provides examples of other activities done while hiking, introducing them with 'And of course'. Includes the idiom 'horse around' and related words like 'goof off' and 'silly'. Examples are short and specific. A (Address Main Point): Returns to the main point (talking), using 'But for the most part' as a transition. Specifies 'random things' as 'deep things'. Uses 'and so' for flow and 'end up + V-ing' ('end up talking') which is characteristic of AL for ongoing actions/results in habits. Includes the expression 'let it all out'. R (Reflect): Adds a reflective part at the end, using phrases like 'starting to appreciate', 'quality time', and 'makes life worth living' to express deeper meaning and realization about the activity. This R part is crucial for achieving an AL score. General feedback includes using fillers like 'you know' naturally, focusing on V-ing forms, and the importance of slowing down and practicing for natural delivery.
