Question 
Talk about your favorite bakery. What is the place like? What kinds of bake goods or treats do they commonly offer?

Answer 
Okay, you are asking me about the favorite bakery cafe. So, let's talk about the one near my house, which is called a rainbow cafe. Uh, I really appreciate this cafe because it offers one of my favorite desserts, which is called a rainbow cake. I really love this um cake because it tastes super amazing. Um, of course, I really love this cake, but um, beside this one, I really like the atmosphere of, you know, bakery bakery. When I step into the bakery cafe, I always can see very kind staff and also I can see very cozy sofa and dining tables, chairs, and those kind of stuff. Uh, but you know, what stands out the most is actually though a rainbow cake. I really super love this cake because I, you know, it tastes a bit like cheesecake, but my favorite one is cheesecake though. So, um, this is why I really like this bakery store. So, maybe if you can join me in next time, I will I will highly recommend you join me.

Feedback 
The answer sounds scripted because it uses 'cafe' frequently when the question is specifically about a 'bakery'. Stick to 'bakery'. Instead of 'it offers', use 'they offer'. Change 'cake' to 'bread' as it's a bakery. Correct pronunciation of 'super' (super vs. super). Change 'beside' to 'besides'. Use 'I always see' instead of 'I always can see'. Correct 'those kind of stuff' to 'those kinds of things' or 'that kind of stuff'. Avoid redundant phrases like 'really super'. Do not mention that something else (like cheesecake) is your favorite if the question is about the bakery's product. Avoid starting too many sentences with 'So'. Do not invite the examiner to join you; recommend the place to someone visiting the country instead.
