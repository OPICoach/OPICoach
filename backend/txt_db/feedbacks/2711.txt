Question 
Recycling habits combo set: 1. People's recycling habits. 2. Your recycling habits.

Answer 
Example answer for 'your habit': Talk about throwing away many shipment boxes because your wife orders a lot online, and you are the one who has to dispose of them. Strategies: Start by briefly mentioning people's habits (e.g., 'we recycle quite well here'), then quickly transition to your own habit using phrases like 'but you know what? For me...'. Use the quick comparison strategy (e.g., past vs. present recycling habits) if needed to extend the answer. If the next question is very similar and you've already covered the content, skip it.

Feedback 
Recycling is a very difficult OPIC topic. It's crucial to control the narrative and transition smoothly from talking about people to talking about yourself. Using 'we' is often better than 'people' when referring to Koreans. Advanced fillers like 'but you know what? For me...' help with transitions and sound natural. The quick comparison strategy (e.g., past vs. present) can help extend your answer. If a subsequent question is very similar to one you've already answered sufficiently, you should skip it to avoid repetition and potentially losing points. Do not skip questions just because you don't want to answer; skip only when the content is redundant. The 'four category strategy' is essential and should be known before taking the test.
