Question 
How has technology changed from the past to the present? What was the technology you used in the past like? What is it like now?

Answer 
Well, I personally think there has been a lot of progress in technology. And I want to explain this with a specific example. Before, cell phones were huge and heavy. As far as I can remember, they were very ugly. But now, cell phones come in different designs. And they are much lighter and smaller. Oh and cell phones these days have touchable display. And surprisingly, some of them are foldable, right? I am enjoying amazing new functions I couldn't use before like video chatting, online banking system, and so on. So I cannot wait for the new technologies that will change the world in the future.

Feedback 
Start naturally with 'Well'. Use 'I personally think' as a filler and for a nice expression. Use 'a lot of progress'. It's strategic to use 'a specific example' like a cell phone. Use 'Before' to signal the past. Use past tense for past descriptions ('were huge and heavy', 'were very ugly'). Use 'As far as I can remember' for talking about past memories. Use 'But now' to signal the present. Use present tense for present descriptions ('come in different designs', 'are much lighter and smaller', 'have touchable display', 'are foldable'). Use connecting phrases like 'Oh and' to sound conversational. Use 'surprisingly'. Use 'I am enjoying' for current actions/states. Mention specific new functions like 'video chatting', 'online banking system', and use 'and so on'. Use 'I cannot wait for' to express anticipation for the future. Ensure consistent use of past tense for the past and present tense for the present. Speak enthusiastically.
