Question 
What do people do to celebrate the holidays in your country? Are there any traditions regarding the holidays? Do they cook any special food? Or do people observe any customs to commemorate any events in the history? Please tell me about the things that people do for the holidays.

Answer 
(IH Level Option): I already talked about what people do during holidays in the previous answer. So I don't think I have much to add. I'm sorry. So can I move on to the next question?
(AL Level Option): Like I mentioned before, people take a break from work or school and have a get together with family and enjoy traditional food during holidays, you know. Speaking of which, the most popular one is called 떡국, which is rice cake soup. It's a must-have dish for New Year's Day. I just thought of something else, you know, besides gatherings and food. When families get together, they sometimes play like board games, you know like Yut Nori, card games like Go Stop. Also these days going on trips instead of having traditional gatherings and meals is also popular. So overall, in a nutshell, the main idea of holiday activities is spending quality time with my family and friends. Besides, it's a chance to relax a bit. With the New Year's Day coming up soon in Korea, I'm already looking forward to having downtime.

Feedback 
This question often repeats content from the previous one. For IH, it's acceptable to state you already answered and ask to move on to avoid repetition. For AL, you must paraphrase and add more detail or different aspects. Use diverse linking words instead of just 'also', such as 'on top of that', 'another important part is', 'speaking of which', 'besides'. Use correct prepositions, e.g., 'go on trips', not 'go to trips'. Learn useful phrases like 'must-have dish', 'I just thought of something else', 'in a nutshell', 'spending quality time', 'having downtime', 'looking forward to'.
