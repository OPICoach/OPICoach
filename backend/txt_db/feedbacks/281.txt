Answer 
Um, people can have health problems such as diabetes, obesity, and you know, high blood pressure um called lifestyle disease. You know, this kind of health problems happens because um people don't get enough exercise. Also, I think people have to care about what they eat. And what they should not eat. Plus, people should work out regularly. However, I think it's not easy to make spare time to work out. Eating healthy and um getting enough exercise must be the most important to fix health problems. You know, also I think we should do something to relieve stress. Um, I think doing outdoor activities like hiking can be a good way to you know, get rid of stress. So, well, um lifestyle diseases can be a big problem to us, but I think there are so many things we can do to deal with them.

This is a good answer incorporating many key strategies for OPIc, especially for IH/AL levels. You've addressed both the problems and potential solutions as requested by the question.

**Vocabulary:** Excellent use of specific vocabulary like 'diabetes', 'obesity', 'high blood pressure', and the key term 'lifestyle disease'. Using 'work out regularly' is better than just 'exercise'. You've also used synonyms for 'relieve stress' ('get rid of stress'), which adds variety. 'Deal with' is a great phrasal verb to use for 'solve' or 'handle problems'.

**Grammar & Structure:**
*   You've effectively used filler words (um, you know, well, so) to sound natural and give yourself thinking time. This helps avoid sounding memorized.
*   Sentence structures are varied. You use simple sentences, sentences with clauses ('because people don't get enough exercise'), and structures like 'it's not easy to make spare time', which uses 'it to' and is a good point for higher scores.
*   Using gerunds as subjects ('Eating healthy', 'Doing outdoor activities') is also a good grammatical point.
*   You used a modal verb ('must be') to express importance.
*   Transition words like 'Also', 'Plus', 'However', 'So' help connect your ideas smoothly.

**OPIc Strategy:**
*   You provided specific examples of health problems (diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure) and solutions (exercise, diet, stress relief, outdoor activities like hiking). Giving details and examples is crucial for higher levels.
*   You used phrases like 'I think' and 'I guess' to express your opinion in a soft, natural way, avoiding overly definitive statements.
*   Maintaining a continuous flow of speech with fillers is much better than having long, awkward pauses between sentences.

**Areas for Potential Enhancement (for AL):**
*   While you used 'it to' and gerunds, incorporating more complex structures or a wider range of modal verbs could further boost your score.
*   Ensuring consistent intonation and stress on key words (like 'most important') helps convey emotion and avoids a flat, memorized delivery.
*   If this were a longer answer, ensuring smooth transitions between paragraphs or distinct points would be important.
