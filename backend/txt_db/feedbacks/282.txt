Question 
Who do you talk to on the phone? How often do you call your friends or family? Do you make phone calls for work? What do you usually talk about and for how long? I'd like to know what kind of things you talk about during phone conversation. Please tell me what topics you talk about on the phone.

Answer 
All right, um to be honest, I don't talk on the phone a lot. Um well, instead, I use a messaging app called like Kakao Talk. I exchange a lot of instant messages with my family and friends, you know. Um the best part of this app is um everything is free. Also, I can buy things or send presents to people through this app. However, you know, when I feel bored, and I want to talk to someone, I make phone calls to my friends. You know also, when I want to have a long conversation or make a plan to do something with my friends or family members, I call them. All in all, I usually talk to my friends through a messaging app. except when I want to have an actual conversation.

Feedback 
Use fillers like 'All right, um' at the start. Avoid starting the answer immediately. Use natural intonation and vary your speed; avoid a monotonic tone. Learn useful vocabulary like 'messaging app', 'instant message', and 'app' (instead of application). Use connecting words and phrases like 'instead', 'Also', 'However', and 'All in all' to structure your answer. Correct common grammar mistakes such as 'feel boring' (should be 'feel bored'), 'talk someone' (should be 'talk to someone'), and 'call to them' (should be 'call them'). Remember you don't need to answer every single part of the question; focus on the main topic and type (explanation).
