Question 
Tell me about a recent phone call you remember. Who did you talk to and what did you talk about? What made that phone call so memorable? Please tell me about your recent phone conversation.

Answer 
Storyline: I don't usually make calls, but I did call a friend recently because something bad happened at work. I talked to my friend about it. My friend didn't necessarily give me advice, but talking helped me feel better. This is why friends are great.

Feedback 
This question requires using the past tense correctly. Pay attention to intonation, especially on key words like 'recent phone conversation'. A possible way to start is 'Well, you know, I don't think anything memorable has happened while talking on the phone.' This is useful when you feel the question is too specific or you don't have a strong specific memory. For IH/AL, focus on varied sentence patterns and natural delivery rather than just memorizing fancy expressions. Avoid sounding like a robotic, memorized answer. Ensure correct usage of past tense verbs throughout the story.
