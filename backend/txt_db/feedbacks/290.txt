Feedback 
Detailed feedback from the instructor:
- Use fillers like 'Well', 'you know', 'like', 'so' to make the answer flow naturally.
- Incorporate adjectives to describe things vividly (e.g., 'beautiful', 'coastal', 'typical', 'trendy', 'busy', 'noisy', 'crowded', 'bustling', 'small', 'cramped', 'quiet', 'peaceful', 'scenic', 'convenient'). Adjectives are crucial for higher scores (AL).
- Use 'used to' to talk about past habits or states (e.g., 'I used to live...', 'I used to hang out...'). This is suitable for OPIc.
- Practice common phrases for describing distance/time (e.g., 'It takes about like three hours by express train').
- Use varied sentence starters and patterns. Avoid starting every sentence with 'I', 'we', or 'you'.
- Learn useful phrases like 'as for X' (regarding X), 'to give you a more detailed account' (to explain in more detail), 'what makes X so special is Y' (what makes X special is Y), 'Another thing that I like about X is Y' (another thing I like about X is Y).
- Use phrases like 'go to place' to mean your favorite or most frequently visited place.
- Pay attention to past tense forms (e.g., 'grew up', 'hung out'). If unsure, 'used to' can sometimes be an alternative.
- Avoid trying to explain overly complex or culturally specific details that are difficult to translate into English.
- Practice ending sentences with falling intonation, not rising intonation, to sound confident and avoid sounding like you're asking a question or recalling memorized lines.
- Aim to integrate learned expressions naturally rather than sounding like you're reciting a memorized template. Combine phrases learned from different contexts.
