Answer 
Wow, that's a hard one. I haven't thought about it. But I can say my smartphone is an important part of my life. I mean, I do many different things on my phone. So, let me tell you about what I usually do with my phone. First of all, I surf the internet on my phone every day. I love listening to music and watching music videos, so I installed YouTube on my phone. Also, I watch a lot of movies and TV shows on my phone. My phone screen is not very big, but I can still read subtitles. Oh, one more thing. I search online when I need information. You know, there's literally everything on the internet. Anyway, thanks to modern technology. We can do a lot of things fast and easily. Honestly, I feel like I can't live without my phone sometimes.
