Question 
I'd like to know about the issues or problems today's parks are faced with. Please tell me the challenges public parks are going through these days. What has caused these problems? What kind of things have to be done to deal with these issues?

Answer 
Well, I don't think we have a lot of problems with parks. However, sometimes there are some problems with the trash. When the weather is nice, some parks are very popular for having picnics and camping. Also, when there are festivals and fireworks, the parks around that area are crowded. So, after these events, taking care of the garbage can be a problem. Another problem I can think of is that there's a lot of traffic around the parks on the weekends.

답변 시작 시 'Well, I don't think' 패턴을 사용하여 자연스럽게 시작하세요. 답변 시 템포 조절과 인토네이션 변화를 통해 암기한 느낌을 피해야 합니다. 'go through'(겪다), 'deal with'(해결하다)와 같은 구동사 사용을 추천합니다. 'drop litter'(쓰레기를 버리다), 'must be fined'(벌금 물려야 한다) 등 관련 어휘를 활용하면 좋습니다. 'Another problem I can think of is that...' 또는 'Another thing I can think of is that...' 패턴을 사용하여 다른 문제점을 언급하세요. 해결책까지 자세히 말할 필요는 없습니다. 발음보다 강세와 인토네이션이 중요하며, 암기한 답변은 감점이 아닌 0점 처리될 수 있음을 유의하세요.
