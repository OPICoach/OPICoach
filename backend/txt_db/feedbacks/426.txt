Question 
Tell me about a memorable experience you had.

Answer 
One memorable shopping incident was when I went shopping for a birthday gift for my best friend. We decided to visit a local artisan market together. While browsing, I stumbled upon a beautiful, handcrafted necklace that I knew would be perfect for her. The intricate design and vibrant colors instantly caught my eye. My friend helped me choose the perfect piece, offering her input on style and preferences. We enjoyed exploring the market together, sampling local delicacies and admiring various handmade items. The shopping experience was not only enjoyable but also strengthened our bond as friends. Seeing the joy on my friend's face when she received the necklace made the entire experience truly unforgettable.
