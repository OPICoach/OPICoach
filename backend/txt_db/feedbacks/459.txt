Question 
Clara, what types of clothes do people in your country typically wear? Please describe it using as much detail as possible.

Answer 
People typically wear clothes differently according to the four seasons in Korea. In spring and fall, which have mild and clear weather, people wear shirts and jeans or light clothes. In summer, it's scorching hot, so people wear t-shirts and shorts. In winter, it's the opposite, freezing cold, so people wear long underwear and jumpers. The answer can be structured by dividing it into seasons.

Feedback 
The question asks about typical wear, so use the present tense. It's helpful to divide the answer by categories, such as seasons, when you don't have much to say. Korea has four seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter. Spring and fall have mild and clear weather, suitable for shirts and jeans or light clothes. Summer is scorching hot, requiring t-shirts and shorts. Winter is freezing cold, necessitating long underwear and jumpers. Useful expressions include 'I think' (filler), 'wear differently according to seasons', 'mild and clear weather', 'light clothes', 'scorching hot', 't-shirts and shorts', 'it's the opposite', 'freezing cold', 'long underwear', 'jumpers as well', 'multiple layers of clothes', 'don't catch a cold'. Remember to use 'people' as the subject when asked about 'people', and 'I' when asked about 'you', although adding a personal example at the end of a 'people' question is fine.
