To answer about a memorable movie, you can connect it to other memorable experiences like concerts, performances, or TV programs. Use the phrase 'the most memorable movie I've watched'. Describe the plot or storyline and explain what made it special, using adjectives like 'thought-provoking', 'thrilling', or 'original' to describe scenes. Linking the movie to your favorite actor can also strengthen your answer. Structure your response and consider recommending the movie by saying 'I recommend watching...' or 'If you haven't watched this movie, I recommend...'
