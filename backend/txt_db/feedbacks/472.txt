Question 
Question 11. Where is your favorite place to go hiking? Why do you prefer that place? Describe it in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
Without a doubt, my favorite place to go hiking is Namsan Mountain. There are several reasons for my preference. To start with, it's within walking distance of my house. So I can go whenever I'm off for it. Oh and, it has breathtaking scenery and fresh air. Hiking while enjoying the amazing view is a great stress reliever. Last but not least, there are many street vendors that sell delicious street food. It's the highlight of hiking.

Feedback 
This is a location description question asking for your favorite place and the reasons why. You should focus on describing the place and explaining your preference. Use phrases to introduce your favorite place like 'Without a doubt, my favorite place to go hiking is...'. When listing reasons, use transitions like 'There are several reasons for my preference', 'To start with', 'Oh and', 'Last but not least'. Useful vocabulary includes 'within walking distance', 'whenever I'm off for it' (or 'whenever I want to go'), 'breathtaking scenery', 'fresh air', 'amazing view', 'great stress reliever', 'street vendors', 'street food', 'the highlight'. Detail is important, but focus on the reasons for your preference which naturally include descriptive elements. You don't need a formal conclusion.
