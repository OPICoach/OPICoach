Question 
Question 12. Do you have an experience of getting injured while hiking? Please describe what happened in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
Um, I do not have an experience of getting injured while hiking. Instead, I will talk about the last time I went hiking. The last time I went hiking was a couple of days ago. I was really stressed out, so I wanted to get some fresh air. I went there with my friend Sam. While hiking, we talked about our day and current events. It was a great time. I am planning to go again very soon.

Feedback 
This question asks about a past experience (getting injured). If you don't have that specific experience, it's okay to say so ('I do not have an experience of getting injured while hiking' or 'I do not have that experience'). You can then pivot to a related topic, such as the last time you went hiking or a memorable hiking experience ('Instead, I will talk about...'). Ensure you use the past tense for describing past events ('went', 'was', 'was stressed out', 'wanted to', 'talked about'). Useful phrases for describing the last time you did something include 'The last time I went hiking was a couple of days ago'. Other useful expressions: 'stressed out', 'wanted to get some fresh air', 'talked about our day and current events', 'It was a great time'. If you mention future plans, switch to present/future tense ('I'm planning to go again'). When pivoting, make sure the alternative topic is still related to the original theme (hiking) to avoid sounding completely off-topic.
