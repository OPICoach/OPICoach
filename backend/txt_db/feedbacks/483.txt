Question 
Reflect on something you had to work on that required a lot of research on the internet. What was the project? When did you work on it? How did you use the internet to complete the project?

Answer 
Well, an experience with a project or an experience with the internet? Hmm, well let me see. I can't think of any experience like this right now. I'm sorry, but I'll just skip this question. If it's okay with you, can I just move on to the next question?

Feedback 
This response demonstrates strategies for handling unexpected questions, as taught in the lecture. Starting by rephrasing ('an experience with a project or an experience with the internet?') shows understanding of the question's topic. Using phrases like 'Well, let me see' buys time. Stating 'I can't think of any experience like this right now' directly addresses the lack of a specific answer. Finally, politely asking to skip the question ('I'm sorry, but I'll just skip this question,' 'If it's okay with you, can I just move on to the next question?') is a strategic way to move on while minimizing potential penalties, as suggested by the lecturer. The lecturer notes that skipping one or two questions politely might not result in significant deductions. The phrases 'I've never had any experience like this' or 'I've never experienced anything like this' could also be used here.
