Question 
Which websites and technology do you use when you work on a project?

Answer 
I use a lot of website and technology when I work on project. Google has a lot of information. YouTube has various video clips.

Feedback 
While starting by echoing the question is good, the rest of the answer is too simple and just lists general facts about Google and YouTube. It doesn't explain *how* these technologies are used specifically for projects or provide any concrete examples. Simply stating 'Google has a lot of information' or 'YouTube has various video clips' isn't enough. You need to describe their function and importance in your workflow to get a high score.
