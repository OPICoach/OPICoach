Question 
What do you usually do at cafe? Who do you go with? What do you like to order?

Answer 
Going to a cafe is my stress reliever. Cafe is a perfect place to study without any distractions. I usually go to the cafe with my classmate. He teaches me how to speak in English. I have an obsession with food. I have a chat with my friend while having a slice of chocolate cake and americano. No doubt, caffeine has a positive impact on my long-term memory. Anyway, the cafe can improve my concentration and productivity in many ways.

Feedback 
This AL-level answer starts with a dynamic introduction using a gerund subject ('Going to a cafe is my stress reliever'), which can be adapted for other topics. It uses specific details with prepositional phrases ('without any distractions'). Mentioning who you go with and adding a brief description ('He teaches me how to speak in English') helps connect to other potential topics like character description. Phrases like 'have an obsession with food' are idiomatic. Using 'while' to connect actions is good. 'No doubt' is a useful transition. Phrases like 'have a positive impact on' and 'improve my concentration and productivity' demonstrate higher-level vocabulary and structure. Remember to use the present tense for usual activities.
