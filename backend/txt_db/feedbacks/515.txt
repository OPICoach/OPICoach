Feedback 
Aim for naturalness using fillers (well, um, you know). Briefly summarize the situation (1-2 sentences) at the start. Ask 3-4 questions, but prioritize fluency; ending after 2-3 questions fluently is better than struggling for more. Use specific phrasing like 'Can I get a discount?' and 'Do you have a king size bed?'. Add simple reactions after asking questions to enhance the roleplay feel. Keep the answer concise, ideally around 1 minute or less. Pay attention to pronunciation. Remember to end the conversation properly.
