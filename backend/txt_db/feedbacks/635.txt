Question 
Tell me about something that you have heard or read about recycling in the news. What was it about? Give me all the details about that issue on recycling.

Answer 
Oh my gosh. I have to say this is a really difficult question. Well, honestly, I have no idea about this topic. I mean, I haven't thought about this. This is something I've never thought about. You know, I hardly watch the news these days. I haven't watched any news related to recycling. So, I can't think of any issues related to recycling. But I know that recycling is mandatory in Korea. Uh, yeah, seriously, I would say recycling is very well practiced everywhere in Korea. Um, well, I guess that's all I can say about this topic. And I'm gonna have to say recycling has become people's daily lives in Korea. Well, that's it. Thank you.

Feedback 
This is a high-difficulty question asking about specific issues related to recycling from the news. It's challenging even in your native language. The provided answer is a strategic approach when you don't know the specific details but want to provide some response. Key feedback points:

1.  **Opening/Fillers:** Phrases like 'Oh my gosh', 'I have to say', 'Well', 'honestly', 'I mean', 'You know', 'seriously', 'Um' are excellent fillers and help you sound natural, buy time, and express emotion/reaction. They make the answer less robotic.
2.  **Expressing Difficulty:** 'This is a really difficult question' or 'This is a really hard question/one' clearly communicates that you find the question challenging. This is acceptable.
3.  **Expressing Lack of Knowledge/Thought:** Phrases like 'I have no idea about this topic', 'I haven't thought about this', 'This is something I've never thought about' are effective ways to honestly state you haven't considered this before. Using 'have PP' (e.g., 'haven't thought', 'never thought') correctly shows advanced tense usage.
4.  **Explaining Why You Don't Know:** Stating 'I hardly watch the news these days' or 'I haven't watched any news related to recycling' provides a plausible reason for not knowing recent issues. 'Hardly' and 'haven't watched/read' are good vocabulary/grammar choices.
5.  **Inability to Recall Issues:** 'I can't think of any issues related to recycling' directly addresses the 'issues' part of the question. Practice the pronunciation of 'can't think of'. Alternatives for 'issues' are 'problems' or 'concerns'.
6.  **Providing General Information:** Even without knowing a specific issue, you can provide general facts about the topic in your country. Stating 'recycling is mandatory in Korea' and 'recycling is very well practiced everywhere in Korea' shows you know something about the topic. 'Mandatory' and 'well practiced' are good vocabulary.
7.  **Concluding:** Phrases like 'I guess that's all I can say about this topic' or 'I'm gonna have to say...' provide a clear signal that you are finishing your response. 'Recycling has become people's daily lives' is a good concluding statement about its importance. 'That's it. Thank you' is a simple and effective way to end.
8.  **Delivery:** Emphasize using appropriate intonation and emotion (acting) to make the response sound spontaneous and not memorized. Practice pronunciation of difficult words like 'thought', 'honestly', 'news'.

Overall, this answer demonstrates the ability to handle a difficult question by using fillers, expressing difficulty and lack of specific knowledge honestly, providing some general relevant information, and concluding clearly. This strategy can help achieve higher grades even when faced with challenging topics.
