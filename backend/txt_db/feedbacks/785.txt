Question 
What types of clothing and footwear do you wear for hiking and trekking? Discuss the supplies and foods that you typically take with you. Where do you usually go?

Answer 
So I usually go to 남산 마운틴 for hiking. I go on weekends with my friends. I take several things when I go hiking. First I take my cell phone. As you know, listening to music while hiking helps me be more active. Oh, and a water bottle is a must when I go hiking. I drink water to keep myself hydrated. I wear track suit and sneakers. And lastly, I take chocolate and 김밥 with me. They give me instant energy when I'm all worn out.

Feedback 
This question is longer and asks about clothing, footwear, supplies, and food. The main points are what you wear and what you take. The last part 'Where do you usually go?' is secondary. Again, 'usually' means use the present tense. For IH level, the answer should be longer than IM and include more 'fancy expressions'. Start by stating where you go (connecting to the previous question). Use phrases like 'I take several things when I go hiking'. Use fillers like 'As you know' to sound more natural and buy time. Use interjections like 'Oh, and...' for flow. Key vocabulary and phrases: 'is a must', 'keep myself hydrated' (fancy expression for staying hydrated), 'track suit', 'sneakers', 'instant energy', 'I'm all worn out' (fancy expression for being very tired). When mentioning Korean food like 김밥, it's recommended to explain it in English (e.g., Korean sushi rolls).
