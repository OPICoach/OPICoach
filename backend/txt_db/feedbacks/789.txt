Question 
Have you had any problems with a credit card or a bank card? For example, you might have lost a card or a card would not work. Tell me about that experience.

Answer 
Option 1 (No experience): State that you haven't had problems (e.g., I don't have that kind of experience. I don't know off the top of my head). Explain why, focusing on the convenience of online banking (e.g., I don't go to the bank much because I use online banking. It's very easy and convenient. I can transfer money, pay bills, check balance online). Option 2 (Fabricated/Adapted experience): Start by remembering (e.g., Oh I just remember that...). Describe a past event using past tense (e.g., I went shopping last weekend with my friend. I was looking for clothes. I tried them on and found one I liked). Explain the problem using past tense (e.g., When I tried to pay, my debit card got rejected because the balance was not enough). Describe the resolution (e.g., My friend paid for it, and I paid her back the next day). Conclude by stating this was the only problem (e.g., This is the only problem I've had with a bank card).

Feedback 
Crucially, use past tense consistently for past experiences. Grammar mistakes are less critical than tense errors. If you have no experience, state it clearly and explain why, using vocabulary related to online banking (transfer money, pay bills, check balance, convenient). If fabricating, use a simple narrative structure (setting, event, problem, resolution). Useful phrases for remembering: 'Oh I just remember that'. Shopping vocabulary: 'went to', 'tried on clothes', 'found one that I really liked', 'pay for something'. Problem vocabulary: 'got rejected', 'balance was not enough', 'didn't know what to do'. Resolution vocabulary: 'paid for', 'paid back', 'the next day'. This story template can be adapted for shopping or friend experiences. Use filler words like 'you know', 'well', 'let me see', 'what I'm trying to say is' to sound natural and buy time.
