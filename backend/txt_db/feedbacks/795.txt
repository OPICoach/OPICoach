Question 
Not explicitly provided. The text introduces a creative strategy ('꼴 전략') for OPIc answers.

Answer 
Examples provided for the 'imagine' strategy: 'Imagine that I'm taking a dump' while watching YouTube ('multitasking at its finest'), using a 'high-tech' toilet with a bidet ('cleans my bunghole like new'), or being in a 'huge bathroom' like a 'palace' while 'doing my business'.

Feedback 
The text promotes this as a 'creative' strategy leading to '높은 오팩 점수'. Key feedback on technique: When using 'imagine', typically use the 'present tense' ('I'm taking', 'I look up', 'it's a palace'). Mixing tenses (like returning to present tense from past for the 'imagine' part) is presented as demonstrating '능력'. The examples emphasize vivid description ('absolutely wonderful', 'brand spanking new'). Additional English phrases related to the theme are explained: 'I need to take a dump' (natural phrase), 'You're full of it/shit' (meaning 'nonsense'), and 'Get out of here' (meaning 'no way'/'뻥치지 마').
