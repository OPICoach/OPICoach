Question 
I'd like to know about the weather in your country. Tell me about the seasons. What is the weather like each season? Which season do you personally like the most? Tell me everything and as much details as possible.

Answer 
I think you know, I've got quite a bit to say about your question because my country has four seasons. Anyway, you know, let me start with the spring. When we think of spring, you know, the first words that come to my mind are like warmth and the beauty of nature. The weather is mild and you can enjoy like outstanding scenery of like blooming flowers and trees. Spring and fall are actually the best seasons in Korea for picnics and hiking, you know? Speaking of fall, the leaves change colors, you know, making everything look like stunning. It's a bit chilly. You know, unlike spring and fall, summer in Korea is incredibly hot. Seriously, it's so boiling. And it's getting even hotter because of global warming, you know? Actually it's summer in Korea and it's so muggy and like sweltering, you know? That being said, I like summer the most. You know, because I can go to the beach and have a good time during my summer vacation. But honestly, these days it feels like it's getting like extremely hot, you know? Oh, I forgot to mention winter. Let me talk about that. Like winters here are seriously freezing. Plus, you know, we get a lot of snow as well. You will see like people bundled up with like thick padded jackets and warm winter clothes. Anyway, I think each season has its own unique charm, which can be both like enjoyable and a bit challenging at times, you know? Or, for IH: I think like this we have four seasons here in Korea.

Feedback 
This question asks for a description of the weather and seasons. It's a good topic for using various adjectives. The opening 'I think you know, I've got quite a bit to say...' is a good pattern to show you have things to say. For 'distinct seasons', just saying 'four seasons' is sufficient if 'distinct' is difficult. Avoid 'um um um' hesitation. 'Anyway, let me start with...' is a natural way to begin describing something. For Spring, use words like 'warm', 'mild', 'beauty of nature', 'outstanding scenery'. Avoid repeating 'beautiful'; use synonyms like 'outstanding' or 'stunning'. Spring and Fall are good for activities like 'picnics and hiking'. 'Speaking of fall' is a useful connecting phrase. For Fall, use 'chilly'. For Summer, use stronger adjectives than just 'hot', like 'incredibly hot', 'boiling', 'muggy', 'sweltering'. 'Seriously' is a good adverb for AL. 'That being said' is a useful phrase meaning 'even so' or 'however'. 'Extremely hot' is another good adverb/adjective combination. 'Oh, I forgot to mention...' is a natural way to introduce a missed point. For Winter, use 'seriously freezing' instead of just 'very cold'. 'Plus' is a good connector. 'Bundled up' is a useful phrasal verb for wearing warm clothes. Conclude with a summary like 'each season has its own unique charm' or a simple statement for IH like 'we have four seasons'.
