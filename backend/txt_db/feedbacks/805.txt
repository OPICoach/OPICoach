Question 
I would like to know about the seasons in your country. How many seasons are there? How are they different? What is the weather like in each season?

Answer 
Okay, so Korea used to have four distinct seasons with very different weather. But as you know, unfortunately, well, global warming has caused a lot of changes. These days, yeah, it feels like we only have two seasons, summer and winter. So, let's dive into them. Okay, so in the summer, it's really hot and humid. Honestly, it's too muggy for me. And I'm not a big fan of this weather. But a lot of people enjoy swimming, surfing, or snorkeling. Then there's winter. Yeah, it's so cold. Like, seriously freezing. Even though the temperature sometimes drops below zero, I love this season. Because it's the perfect time to go skiing or build a snowman. Eva, do you want to build a snowman with me? No? Okay, bye.

The answer effectively uses the 'Overall to Specific' structure, starting with the traditional four seasons and narrowing down to the perceived two main seasons (summer and winter) due to global warming. Key patterns like 'used to + 동사' are used correctly to describe past states. 'It feels like + 절' is a good pattern for expressing personal feeling or observation. The answer includes specific vocabulary for weather ('hot', 'humid', 'muggy', 'cold', 'freezing') and activities ('swimming', 'surfing', 'snorkeling', 'go skiing', 'build a snowman'). Phrases like 'I'm not a big fan of' and 'I love this season' add personal touch, which is good for OPIc. Transition phrases like 'but as you know', 'then there's winter' help the flow. Adverbs like 'really', 'honestly', 'seriously' add emphasis and naturalness, but be mindful of pronunciation difficulty. The conclusion is lighthearted and conversational. Pay attention to pronunciation of words like 'used to', 'seasons', 'changes', 'really', 'surfing', 'seriously', and 'perfect'.
