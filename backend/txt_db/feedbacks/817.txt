Question 
I'd like to give you a situation to act out. You and a friend want to go to a concert this weekend. Call the concert venue and book tickets for both of you.

Answer 
Ring ring, ring ring. Hello. Is this Seoul Concert Hall? Hi there. I'm calling to ask about the upcoming rock festival. I'm thinking about attending the spring rock festival this Saturday, and I'd like to get two tickets. So, I was wondering, could I buy the tickets over the phone now? And how much should I pay for the middle seats? Oh, $100? That's kind of expensive. Do you have any special promotions going on this week? Oh, I see. Hmm. Also, would I need to bring my ID to enter the concert hall? Okay. I'll make sure to bring my ID then. And oh, one more thing. I wonder if there's a snack bar or a coffee shop in the theater. Oh, perfect. So where is it? Okay, on the second and the third floor. Awesome. Well, thank you for the information. That was really helpful. So, can I order the tickets over the phone now? Yes. I'd like to buy two tickets for the middle seats, please.

Feedback 
Excellent roleplay performance. The speaker initiates the call realistically ('Ring ring, ring ring', 'Hello. Is this...') and clearly states the purpose ('I'm calling to ask about...', 'I'd like to get two tickets'). The speaker asks relevant questions about booking method ('could I buy the tickets over the phone now?'), price ('how much should I pay?'), discounts ('any special promotions?'), entry requirements ('need to bring my ID?'), and facilities ('snack bar or a coffee shop?'). The reactions to the price ('That's kind of expensive') and information ('Oh, I see. Hmm.', 'Oh, perfect.', 'Awesome.') sound natural. The closing ('Thank you for the information. That was really helpful.') and final request ('I'd like to buy two tickets... please.') are appropriate for the situation. The use of polite phrasing ('I was wondering', 'would I need to', 'I wonder if') is effective.
