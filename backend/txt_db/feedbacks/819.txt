Question 
In your background survey, you indicated that you like going to beaches. Tell me about the beach you like to go to. Where is it located and what does it look like? And what makes the beach so special?

Answer 
Yes, I really like going to beaches. Actually, I've been to so many beautiful beaches in Korea. But my favorite one is located in Jeju Island, Korea. The name of the beach is Hyeopjae Beach. It's on the west side of the island, which is about a 30-minute drive from Jeju International Airport. So what makes Hyeopjae Beach so special is its clear blue water. In addition, it has beautiful white sand where you can just lie down and relax. Oh, one more thing. You can find a nice campground near the beach and enjoy camping there. So, I highly recommend staying there till sunset because the beach has incredibly beautiful sunset. Overall, Hyeopjae Beach in Jeju Island is one of my favorite places to visit during my vacation. Honestly, the beach gets quite crowded during the summer, but I think it is an excellent place to enjoy nature.

Feedback 
The answer effectively addresses all parts of the question, providing location, description, and special features. The vocabulary used is appropriate and descriptive (e.g., 'clear blue water', 'beautiful white sand', 'incredibly beautiful sunset'). The structure is clear, moving from general preference to a specific example and its details. Phrases like 'In addition' and 'Overall' help connect ideas. The inclusion of the campground and sunset adds nice detail. The sentence 'the beach has incredibly beautiful sunset' is understandable, but 'offers' or 'is known for' might sound slightly more natural. The concluding sentence summarizing it as a 'favorite place' is a good wrap-up.
