Question 
There is a problem you need to resolve. You have received the furniture you bought, but there is something wrong with the furniture. Call the furniture store, explain the situation, and ask two or three suggestions to solve the problem.

Answer 
Ring ring. Hello? Is this Hacker's Furniture? Hi. I'm calling because there seems to be a problem with the furniture I bought yesterday. I was at your store yesterday around 4:30 p.m. and I bought this small couch and had it delivered to my apartment this afternoon. So I just received it, but it seems like there's something wrong with the color. Yes, I bought the dark green one, but what I got is dark gray. Yeah, so I wasn't sure what to do. Um, I was wondering, could you pick it up today and deliver a new one sometime tomorrow? Oh, I see. Or, maybe I could just get a refund. Would that be possible? Sure. Please call me back and let me know. Thanks. Bye.

Feedback 
Another excellent role-play demonstrating problem-solving skills.
- Clearly explains the situation: what was bought, when, when delivered, and the specific problem (wrong color).
- Provides sufficient detail (dark green vs. dark gray).
- Asks for clear solutions/suggestions: exchange/redelivery or refund.
- Includes conversational elements ('Um', 'Oh, I see') and simulates pauses for the other person's response.
- The language used is appropriate for explaining a problem over the phone.
