Question 
The provided text describes the OPIc questions asked during a subscriber's test (difficulty 5-5) including topics like Self-Introduction, Hiking, Going to the Park, Home Responsibilities, Doctor's Appointment Roleplay, and a 돌발 question about topics discussed with friends. However, the text does not contain the subscriber's actual spoken answers to these questions.

Answer 
The text does not provide the subscriber's actual answers. It only mentions that the subscriber received an IH grade and used some strategies discussed in OPIc TV content, such as using a pre-prepared answer about the Coronavirus for the final question (15) and initially misunderstanding the 'Home Responsibilities' question as a 'House Description'.

Feedback 
Since the actual student answers are not included in the provided text, it is not possible to give specific feedback on the sentences and words used by the student. The text focuses on describing the questions asked, suggesting general strategies for answering different question types (e.g., using negative experiences for 4/7/10 questions, preparing for cancellation/rescheduling in roleplays, using comparative language for 14/15 questions), and highlighting potential misunderstandings (like the Home Responsibilities topic).
