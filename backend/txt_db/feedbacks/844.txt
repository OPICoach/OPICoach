Question 
Describe one of your family members or friends. What does he or she look like? What is special about the person?

Answer 
Oh wow. My family or friends? Hmm, let's see. Let me see. Ah, it's hard to choose one person. I have a father, I have a mother, I have a sister, I have so many friends. Let's see. Okay, I'd like to talk about one of my best friends. Yes, let me tell you about my bestie, Jenna. So speaking of her appearance, I think she's very pretty. Jenny has an oval face and beautiful big eyes. And maybe that's why she's so photogenic. Also, I feel like her outfits are always so cute. I mean, she's really fashionable. So I like to take her when I go shopping. What else? Um, oh, you know what? Jenny is one of the healthiest people I know. Seriously, she always eats healthy and drinks a lot of water. I'm impressed with her lifestyle, especially with her diet. She keeps a balanced diet with lots of fruit and vegetables. Sometimes we go out to eat at a healthy salad bar. Well, anyway, I'm gonna have to say she's my good friend. I feel like there's more to say about Jenny, but I'll wrap it up here. I'm grateful I have a good friend like Jenny.

Feedback 
This answer template is designed for the OPIc question asking you to describe a family member or friend, focusing on appearance and special characteristics. It is structured with an introduction using filler words to sound natural, two main body paragraphs describing appearance and lifestyle/habits, and a concluding sentence. The introduction uses fillers like 'Oh wow,' 'Hmm, let's see,' and 'Ah, it's hard to choose one person' to buy time and sound conversational. It introduces the person you will describe, a best friend named Jenna, using phrases like 'I'd like to talk about' and 'Let me tell you about.' The first body paragraph describes appearance using phrases like 'speaking of her appearance,' 'very pretty,' 'oval face,' 'beautiful big eyes,' and 'photogenic' (meaning good in photos). It also includes details about her fashion sense ('outfits are always so cute,' 'really fashionable') and connects it to going shopping together. The second body paragraph describes her lifestyle, particularly focusing on health habits, which can be useful for other topics like 'healthy person.' Phrases include 'one of the healthiest people I know,' 'eats healthy,' 'drinks a lot of water,' 'impressed with her lifestyle,' 'balanced diet,' and eating at a 'healthy salad bar.' Fillers like 'What else?' and 'you know what?' are used for transition and sounding natural. The conclusion wraps up the description with phrases like 'Well, anyway,' 'I'm gonna have to say she's my good friend,' 'I'll wrap it up here,' and 'I'm grateful I have a good friend like Jenny.' The feedback emphasizes practicing fillers naturally, varying sentence beginnings, using descriptive vocabulary, connecting ideas smoothly, and leveraging content across different topics (e.g., using the health description for a 'healthy person' topic). Some phrases are noted as being suitable for higher levels (AL).
