Answer 
It's a good question because surfing the internet is something I love to do every day. You know, I can get access to the internet on my phone anytime I want. So I like to visit many different websites, like Google, YouTube, Netflix, etc. Well, let me focus on YouTube and Instagram. So one of my favorite websites is YouTube, which is an American video sharing website. Every time I visit YouTube, I feel like it has videos on literally every topic. So I like that I can watch all kinds of informative and entertaining video clips on YouTube. For instance, I often watch live concerts and music videos on YouTube. Sometimes I learn how to cook and get recipes. Because of its convenience, I can say YouTube has become my go-to website. Another website I like to visit is Instagram. As you might already know, Instagram is a social networking app for sharing photos and videos. You can upload photos and videos from your phone, so it's very easy to use. I like Instagram because it lets me stay up to date with friends as well as with current news and events. Overall, I absolutely love surfing the internet. The websites like YouTube and Instagram are so useful that I can't imagine my life without them. I would say the internet has become an indispensable part of my life because it lets me do all sorts of things.

This is an excellent, well-structured answer that effectively addresses all parts of the question and demonstrates a wide range of vocabulary and grammatical structures suitable for higher OPIc levels (IH-AL). The introduction is engaging and uses natural phrases like "It's a good question" and "You know." Key vocabulary related to internet usage is used correctly, such as "surfing the internet," "get access to the internet," and "visit many different websites." The use of "etc." is a good way to list examples naturally. Focusing on two specific websites (YouTube and Instagram) provides concrete examples as requested. Describing YouTube as a "video sharing website" and Instagram as a "social networking app" shows precise vocabulary. Phrases like "I feel like it has videos on literally every topic" and "all kinds of informative and entertaining video clips" are strong examples of descriptive language and adverbs/adjectives. Using transition words like "For instance" and "Sometimes" helps to list activities. The phrase "has become my go-to website" is a great idiomatic expression. For Instagram, explaining its function and ease of use ("very easy to use") is effective. The sentence "it lets me stay up to date with friends as well as with current news and events" is a sophisticated way to describe its benefit, using "lets me" and "as well as." The conclusion effectively summarizes the importance of the internet using strong phrases like "absolutely love," "so useful that I can't imagine my life without them," and "an indispensable part of my life." The use of the present perfect tense ("has become") adds grammatical complexity. Pronunciation points to practice include "internet," "etc.," and "literally." Overall, this answer is detailed, well-organized, and uses advanced language effectively.
