Question 
You and your family probably have different responsibilities at home. Please tell me about your responsibilities at home. Also, what kind of chores do your family members do? Give me all the details.

Answer 
Um well as I mentioned earlier I live by myself. So um I don't have to do a lot of housework. I just do some chores to clean up the place. Also, you know, it's my habit to tidy up my desk and clean my room before going to bed. I like vacuum the floor almost every day. And um honestly, I'm not that into doing housework, but I enjoy cleaning because I feel refreshed and recharged after finishing it. What's more, I sometimes cook for myself. However, I don't enjoy cooking very much because I'm not a good cook, you know. I mean, I'm not much of a cook, you know. To be honest, I can eat my food, but it's not really tasty. Also, I hate doing the dishes. It's always a hassle, you know, because I'm always really tired after work.

This is a sample AL-level answer for the first question about household chores. It demonstrates diverse vocabulary (tidy up, vacuum, not that into, not much of a cook, hassle, refreshed, recharged), varied sentence patterns (It's my habit to...), use of adverbs (almost every day, honestly), and connectors (as I mentioned earlier, So, Also, However, What's more). It also uses filler words naturally (um, well, you know, I mean) and expresses feelings and reasons. For AL, using different expressions for similar meanings (not a big fan of, not that into, not much of a cook) is important. Practice speaking fluently with natural intonation and stress is crucial. OPIc is not just about memorizing templates but speaking naturally. Utilizing tools like Chat GPT can help check grammar, compare expressions (colloquial vs formal), and get example sentences, but should not be solely relied upon for generating entire templates without understanding the underlying principles and practicing speaking.
