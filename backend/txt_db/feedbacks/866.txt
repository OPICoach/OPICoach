Question 
Handling difficult or unexpected questions during the OPIc test.

Answer 
The video teaches phrases to use when you cannot answer a difficult question. These include: 1. Fillers (e.g., Oh wow, Oh no, Oh my gosh, Whoa, really?, Seriously?, Are you kidding?). 2. Stating the question is difficult (e.g., This is a very difficult question, This is a hard/tricky/complicated question, This is a very hard one). 3. Admitting you don't know (e.g., I don't know, I have no idea, I'm not sure, I'm not really sure, I'm totally lost). 4. Asking to skip or move on (e.g., I'm sorry, but I'll just skip this question, I'm afraid I'll just move on to the next question, Can I just answer your next question?). 5. Explaining the importance of the test and asking for understanding (e.g., Eva, to be honest, I studied very hard..., This test is really important to me..., I really need OPIc score..., I'm sorry I couldn't answer this time, but please give me a chance to answer your next question. I'll try my best. Thank you).

Feedback 
The lesson emphasizes that examiners dislike silence and small voices. It advises using fillers naturally like interjections. It recommends expressing difficulty and admitting not knowing honestly and with feeling. Practice saying 'I don't know' in various ways and with different intonations. When asking to skip, do so confidently, perhaps using 'I'm afraid' for politeness. A more advanced strategy is to explain the importance of the test (for job/graduation) and show sincerity to gain examiner sympathy. Practicing these phrases with '찐 연기' (real acting/sincerity) is crucial for sounding natural and filling the audio gap effectively, potentially leading to a better score than just staying silent or giving a weak answer.
