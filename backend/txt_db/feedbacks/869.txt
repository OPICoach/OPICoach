Question 
What kind of clothes do people in your country usually wear? Do they wear different clothes when they go to work? And when they are relaxing? Describe the local attire in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
Wow, so attire in my country... um, yeah, it's really interesting. Alright, um, you know what? So when relaxing at home, people wear comfortable clothes, like PJs or sweats. Well, however, um, from what I know, um, at work, people used to wear business attire to look more professional and clean. But, as you know, it's pretty stuffy and uncomfortable, right? So, um, nowadays, well, most companies allow employees to wear um, whatever they want, to increase work efficiency. Well, I think that's pretty much it for discussion. Let's move on.

Feedback 
Pronunciation: Pay attention to "clothes" (clooze), "comfortable" (stress on first syllable), "PJs" (easier than pajamas), "nowadays" (stress on first syllable). Vocabulary: Use terms like "attire," "comfortable clothes," "PJs," "sweats," "business attire," "professional," "stuffy," "uncomfortable," "allow A to B," "whatever they want," "work efficiency," "increase work efficiency." Structure/Delivery: Start with acting surprised/thinking. Use fillers like "um," "you know what." Structure the answer clearly (relaxing vs. work). Use connecting phrases like "However," "but," "So." Use "used to" for past habits/states. Use "as you know" and tag questions like "right?" for natural flow. Pause between sections. End with a concluding phrase and transition.
