Question 
Tell me about the changes in fashion trends in your country. What kind of clothes did people wear in the past? What do people wear these days? Describe the differences between them.

Answer 
Okay, um, changes in fashion trends... that's a good question. So, um, in the past, I remember skinny jeans were really popular. For example, um, K-pop idol group named Girls' Generation wore skinny jeans, and they became all the rage. And, um, I even had red skinny jeans back then, which is so cringey now! But, um, nowadays, skinny jeans kind of went out of fashion. Instead, um, oversized pants are more popular. Maybe because they are more comfortable? Plus, um, I don't know why, but they look more fashionable as well. But, you know, since fashion comes full circle, maybe you will see many people wearing skinny jeans in 10 years. Anyway, it's a really hard question.

Pronunciation: Note "nowadays" (stress on first syllable), "all the rage." Vocabulary: Use terms like "changes in fashion trends," "in the past," "these days," "skinny jeans," "oversized pants," "all the rage," "so cringey," "went out of fashion," "more comfortable," "fashionable," "I don't know why," "fashion comes full circle." Structure/Delivery: Structure as a clear comparison (past vs. present). Use connecting phrases like "So," "For example," "And," "But," "Instead," "Maybe because," "Plus." Include specific examples (Girls' Generation) and personal examples ("red skinny jeans," "so cringey"). Use "I don't know why" for subjective reasons. Use "fashion comes full circle" as a concluding thought. It's okay to end simply if needed.
