Question 
Have you ever made plans for a trip but had to cancel at the last minute because of something happened unexpectedly? What was the problem and how did you resolve the situation?

Answer 
Okay, a time when I cancelled a trip? Let's see. Well, I remember a time when I had to cancel a beach trip. It was during the summer break when I was in college. So, let me tell you about what happened. So one day in the summer, I was supposed to go to the beach with my best friend. Our plan was to go to the beach on the east side of Korea and stay at a resort for two days. So we had already booked a room at a resort and we've been so excited about our trip. You know what? The night before the trip, it started raining a lot. All of a sudden, it was pouring. And the rain didn't stop the next day. So guess what? Can you guess what we ended up doing? Unfortunately, we decided to postpone our trip. You know, how could we enjoy our summer vacation at a rainy beach? So it was such a bummer that we had to cancel our trip at the last minute. Because we had been looking forward to it. Well, instead of going to the beach, we just went to the movies and had a good dinner. Well, looking back, I think we still had fun hanging out that night. So anyway, it was a time when I had to postpone a trip because of the rain. Speaking of which, I feel like I want to go to the beach this summer. Maybe I should invite my friend. Hopefully the weather will be nice.

This answer effectively addresses the prompt by describing a trip cancellation due to unexpected rain and how the situation was resolved (postponing the trip and going to the movies instead). Key strengths include: consistent use of past tense (crucial for past experience questions), incorporating various useful phrases (Let me tell you about what happened, was supposed to, Our plan was to, had booked, had been excited, All of a sudden, it was pouring, ended up doing, postpone, such a bummer, at the last minute, had been looking forward to, instead of ing, go to the movies, had fun ing, looking back, Speaking of which, Hopefully), using fillers and rhetorical questions (You know what?, So guess what?, Can you guess?, How could we enjoy...?) to create a conversational tone, and providing a clear structure (introduction, problem description, resolution/alternative, conclusion). Practicing the highlighted past tense verbs and the versatile phrases is recommended for improving fluency and score.
