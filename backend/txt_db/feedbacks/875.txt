Question 
When was the last time you went to the store? Tell me about your most recent grocery shopping.

Answer 
Last Thanksgiving. My family and I visited the store. Actually, we went there for the first time. The store was decorated with colorful flowers. The background music made me happy. I met up with my old friend. We talked about this and that. I had so much fun.

Feedback 
This answer uses the past tense correctly but is basic. To improve, include more emotional expressions (e.g., 'I was looking forward to it', 'It amazed me a lot', 'What a coincidence'), use more varied vocabulary/expressions (e.g., 'ran into' instead of 'met up'), use idiomatic expressions (e.g., 'real bore'), use non-living subjects (e.g., 'Shopping without background music is a real bore', 'Talking with my friends never fails to make me feel relaxed'), and use more complex sentence structures (e.g., sentences starting with gerunds). Focus on using non-living subjects, combining topics, and using colloquialisms.
