Question 
I'd like to know about a restaurant you used to eat out as a child.

Answer 
Oh, a restaurant I used to eat out as a child? Hmm... Oh my gosh, that's a long time ago. Gosh. I don't even know, I don't even remember. Maybe 20 years ago? Yeah, I honestly have no idea. I don't remember the specific restaurant. It's really hard to recall. So, is it okay if I talk about a different restaurant that I like now instead?

Feedback 
This is a great approach when you genuinely cannot remember details about a past experience, especially one from childhood.  Here's a breakdown:

**Strengths:**
*   **Acknowledging the Difficulty:** Phrases like "Oh my gosh, that's a long time ago" and "It's really hard to recall" effectively communicate that the question is challenging due to the time elapsed.
*   **Natural Hesitation:** Using "Hmm..." and pausing shows natural thinking process, which is good in OPIc.
*   **Directly Stating Lack of Memory:** "I don't even remember," "I honestly have no idea," and "I don't remember the specific restaurant" are clear and direct.
*   **Providing Context:** Mentioning "Maybe 20 years ago?" helps quantify how long ago it was.
*   **Offering an Alternative:** Politely asking "So, is it okay if I talk about a different restaurant that I like now instead?" is an excellent strategy. It shows you understand the topic (restaurants) and are willing to talk, even if you can't answer the specific question as asked. This demonstrates flexibility and good communication skills.

**Areas for Minor Refinement (Optional):**
*   The phrase "I don't even know, I don't even remember" is slightly repetitive. You could vary it slightly, but it's perfectly understandable and natural as is.

**Overall:** This is a highly effective way to handle a difficult past experience question in OPIc when you don't have a specific memory. It's honest, natural, and shows you can still communicate and offer relevant information (about restaurants) even when you can't answer the exact question. This strategy is often recommended by OPIc instructors.
