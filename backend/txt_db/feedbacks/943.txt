Question 
Where do you usually shop? Is there a particular store you visit often? Where is it located and why do you prefer that place?

Answer 
Well, these days you know you can do almost everything on your smartphone, right? So basically, it saves so much time. Well, you know what? Just download a shopping app. Yeah, and you can buy whatever you want with just a few taps, in just a few taps. Yeah, I mean, it takes at least some an hour just to get to a shopping mall. But when you shop online, yeah, you don't have to waste time traveling. So, that's why I usually go shopping online.

Feedback 
Good use of the smartphone template. Remember to use fillers like 'you know' and 'well'. Pronunciation tips: 'can' should be weak ('you can do'). Use the tag question 'right?' for a conversational feel. Phrases like 'it saves so much time' and 'with just a few taps' are excellent. When mentioning time, pausing slightly before the number ('at least some an hour') sounds natural. Ensure 'shop online' has stress on 'online'. 'Waste time traveling' is a good expression for avoiding travel time.
