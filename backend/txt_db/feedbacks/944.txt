Question 
Tell me about the banks in your country. Where are they located? When do they open and close? What do they look like? Please describe in as much detail as possible.

Answer 
Oh, these days you know you can do almost everything on your smartphone, right? So basically, it saves so much time. Well, you know what? Just download a banking app. Yeah, and you can do whatever you want with just a few taps, in just a few taps. Yeah, I mean, it takes at least some an hour just to get to a bank. But when you use online banking, yeah, you don't have to waste time traveling. So, that's why I usually bank online.

Feedback 
Excellent adaptation of the smartphone template for the banking topic. The structure is solid. Vocabulary like 'banking app' and 'use online banking' fits well. 'Get to a bank' is the correct phrase for the destination. Using 'bank online' as a verb phrase is a good variation. Continue practicing the flow and intonation, especially with fillers and phrases like 'it saves so much time' and 'waste time traveling'.
