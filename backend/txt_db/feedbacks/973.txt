Feedback 
This is the problem/solution part related to the previous scenario. The role remains the same (customer). Start with an introduction and state the problem, for example, 'Hi, I just bought a t-shirt at your store. And there is a problem.' (mentioning the stain is ideal, but stating 't-shirt has a problem' is acceptable if the specific word is unknown). Use the versatile phrase 'I can think of several options' before suggesting solutions. Example solutions include: 'get a full refund' or 'exchange for new one'. An optional third solution is 'you could give me store credit' if the item is sold out. After suggesting options, use versatile phrases like 'Which option do you prefer?' or 'Do you have another option in mind?'. End with a conclusion like 'Okay, I will visit your store today. Thanks a lot. Bye.' The teacher emphasizes acting naturally and showing emotion throughout the role-play.
