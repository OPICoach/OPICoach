Feedback 
The provided text is a lecture by an OPIc instructor explaining how to answer this type of question. It does not contain specific feedback on a student's answer. The instructor suggests starting with 'Excuse me' (though notes cultural nuances), 'I'm sorry to bother you, but I think I've got a problem', 'This isn't what I ordered', 'I think there's been a mistake with my order', and 'Could you please help me with that?'. Providing alternatives (like waiting for the correct dish, or leaving if it takes too long) is mentioned, but the instructor emphasizes that simply stating the problem and asking for help is often enough for target levels. Length is not critical for problem-solving tasks (Q12).
