Feedback 
This answer follows the suggested structure: Introduction (greeting, thanking for invitation, stating purpose), Body (asking 3 questions with details/reasons), and Conclusion (thanking, expressing anticipation, closing).  Specific feedback:
- Introduction: 'ring ring hello' simulates a phone call. 'How's it going' is a natural alternative to 'How are you'. 'I'm so excited about the party' shows enthusiasm. 'Thank you for inviting me' is polite. 'I just wanted to get some information about the party' directly addresses the prompt. 'I have a few questions' clearly states the intention.
- Question 1 (Time): 'So I was wondering' is a good transition. 'what time should I be there' is a natural way to ask arrival time. 'I heard the party starts at 6' shows prior knowledge. 'I wasn't sure if you would want me to come early and help you prepare for the party' is an advanced (AL level) sentence showing thoughtfulness and willingness to help. 'Sure I can okay I'll be there by 5:30' assumes the friend's positive response and confirms the time, demonstrating interaction.
- Question 2 (Food): 'Then how about the food' is a simple, effective transition. 'I know it's BYOB' uses relevant cultural knowledge (Bring Your Own Beer/Booze). 'I'm planning to bring...' states the plan. 'but I can also bring some desserts like cookies you know' is an indirect suggestion/question, showing flexibility and thoughtfulness (AL level). 'oh okay maybe I'll bake some butter cookies' assumes the friend accepted the offer and confirms the action, demonstrating interaction.
- Question 3 (Parking): 'And one more thing' is a good connector for the last question. 'can I park there' is a direct question. 'is there a place to park for free' is a more specific question relevant to a residential area (vs. 'parking lot' for businesses). 'I'm thinking of driving my car that night' provides context. 'and I wasn't sure where to park' explains the reason for the question. 'Oh perfect yeah send me the address' assumes the friend's positive response and confirms the next step, demonstrating interaction. The speaker notes that assuming the friend's response is easier than doing a full 1인 2역 (one-person two-role play).
- Conclusion: 'Awesome thanks 민수' is a casual, friendly closing. 'I can't wait for the party' expresses anticipation (alternative: 'I'm looking forward to the party'). 'I'll see you on Saturday Bye bye' is a standard closing.
